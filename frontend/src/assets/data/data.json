Arrested and imprisoned by the Italian Fascist regime in 1926, Gramsci died before fully regaining his freedom, yet he wrote extensive letters while incarcerated, rich with insight into the physical and psychological tortures of prison. In meticulous detail, Gramsci records how political prisoners, himself included, contend with the fear of illness and death and the rules and regulations that threaten to efface their individuality. Forming an incomparable link between Gramsci's intellectual passion and his emotional vulnerability, Letters from Prison shows a man reconstructing his life while being separated from it, struggling to recapture the primary relationships that once defined his identity. Frank Rosengarten divides more than four hundred Gramsci letters into two companion volumes, complete with a chronology of the thinker's crucial life experiences, an introduction that sheds light on the main experiences and themes in the letters, biographical notes on his correspondents, and a bibliography of works cited in his letters.\"",

The Notebooks, in fact, were ordered according to a chronological criterion reconstructed on the basis of objective data taken from the \"Description of the Notebooks\" (section included in the critical apparatus) and which led to a new numbering. An attempt was also made to reproduce the text as it was written, so that nothing came between the author's thought and the reader. The wide critical apparatus, then, avoiding any prevarication of an interpretative nature, responds to the need to provide the reader with all the useful elements for a more exact understanding and deepening of Gramscian work.\n\n\"Gramsci began writing the Notebooks, in the Turi prison, on February 8, 1929, exactly two years and three months after his arrest (November 8, 1926). The slowness of this gestation depends only in part on external conditions. Prisoner of that regime in which Marxism has become a crime, he knows he must be prepared for everything: even to \"disappear like a stone in the ocean\" (this is the first impression he receives when he learns in the Roman prison of Regina Coeli, erroneously, that he was destined for deportation to Somalia). In the uncertainty of the fate that awaits him, even when the glimmer of a less pessimistic perspective seems to open up, the problem of the study initially presents itself to him as a self-defense system against the danger of brutalization by which he feels threatened \".\"",

            "description": "\"L'Ordine Nuovo (Italian for \"The New Order\") was a weekly newspaper established in 1919 in Turin, Italy, by a group, including Antonio Gramsci, Angelo Tasca and Palmiro Togliatti, within the Italian Socialist Party. The group were admirers of the Russian Revolution and strongly supported the immediate creation of soviets in Italy. They believed that existing factory councils of workers could be strengthened so that they could become the basis of a communist revolution. However, Amadeo Bordiga, who would become the founder of the Communist Party of Italy, criticised the plan as syndicalism, saying that soviets should only be created after Italy had come under communist control. Initially the newspaper, which was founded with union backing, focused on cultural politics, but in June 1919, the month following its founding, Gramsci and Togliatti pushed Tasca out and re-focused as a revolutionary voice. The newspaper reached a circulation of 6,000 by the end of the year and its reputation was heightened by its support of the April 1920 general strike, which the Socialist Party and the affiliated General Confederation of Labor did not support. In January 1921, Bordiga and the supporters of L'Ordine Nuovo left the Socialist Party in order to establish the new Communist Party of Italy\" Description by: https://archive.org/details/OrdineNuovoP3.",

            "description": "\"The Gramscian theme of Americanism and Fordism was for a long time proposed as a \"classic\" analysis of the novelties of capitalism in the face of the world crisis. Often expanded beyond its historical limits, it then underwent some understandable reaction of rejection. Is it possible to read it correctly today, revealing its current efficacy points? Whoever goes through the knots of these pages will clearly see the starting point of Gramsci's reflection: the modernization and development of the productive forces are an essential requirement of that historical phase. In line with the trend, the solution to the problem can only come from the advent of the working class in the direction of production, society and the state. This is an idea-force already present in Gramsci's \"council\" elaboration of the \"New Order\". But the developments of the world crisis show that, alongside the socialist hypothesis, there is also a capitalist response to the problem of modernization: it manifests itself not only on the level of the organization of production, but also on that of society and the state. For Gramsci, Americanism expresses the most advanced form of the capitalist challenge, capable of integrating innovation and restoration, \"programmatic\" economy and the freedom of the capitalists, in a process of \"passive revolution\" that risks putting the revolutionary forces in check. The rich apparatus of notes clarifies and historicizes this Gramscian approach, placing it at the crossroads of some fundamental themes of the culture of the 1930s: from the internal reflection of the leading group of the International, to the discussions on the \"new economy\" of Rathenau, to the debates on a hypothetical modernizing turn of European fascisms.\"",

The initiative, promoted by the Istituto Gramsci and undertaken by the publisher Einaudi, meets a need now widely felt among scholars and readers: that is, to arrange, as has already happened with the Letters from prison and the Prison Notebooks , of a corpus of writings founded on the greatest possible completeness and collected with the utmost scientific scruple: this is an indispensable condition for the deepening of any critical work. As such, the new edition of the Works preceding the prison years replaces the previous Einaudian edition, which appeared in five volumes between 1954 and 1971 (... ). Even without undermining the lines, already widely known, of Gramsci's political and intellectual biography, the overall study of these writings allows in many points a more detailed reconstruction and in keeping with its intrinsic development. Furthermore, beyond their contingent occasionality, they make it possible to ascertain and document the genesis of a series of Gramscian interests and \u201cplaces\u201d that will find development and critical outlet in the following years and in particular in the reflection of the Prison Notebooks \u00bb.\"",

The result is the profile of a classic of twentieth-century political thought, which has focused in an exemplary way the changes in the world in the first half of the past century, offering an original interpretation of the main historical events and trends that herald the future: the Great War, the eruption of the working and peasant masses on the world stage, the Russian Revolution, fascism, the Great Depression, \"Americanism\" and Stalinism.\nHowever, Gramsci is not only an interpreter, but also a politician, who questions world history in an era of crisis, wars and revolutions; which scrutinizes the \"great and terrible world\" to derive a political program for Italy, which has fallen into the night of fascism, and to change the course of international communism. The history of Italy and the way in which the waves of change originating from the Russian Revolution and the emergence of the \"American century\" are grafted, therefore constitute the leitmotif of the pages chosen to bring new readers closer to his thought, stimulate their curiosity and entice them to deepen the knowledge of all his work.\"",

It is a posthumous book, the first edition of which I have at hand, a family book, as it is for not a few Italian families. Its story, as Francesco Giasi explains in the introduction, begins the day after the death of its author, which took place in Rome on April 27, 1937. The first edition had 218 letters. Here are 511, 12 of which are unpublished. It is the very personal story of a thought disputed between the logic of the apparatus, freedom of vision, pain and tenacity of commitment. The letters run parallel to the drafting of the Prison Notebooks, which in turn represent one of the peaks of Italian essay thinking of the twentieth century, translated and studied all over the world. They constitute the existential parallel and, perhaps, the premise and the condition. In all its editions, thanks to or despite its editors, Lettere dal carcere has always appeared to its reader not as a book-archive, but as a complete and autonomous work, because it is a self-portrait of a living thought in its becoming, in its unfolding, but also in its radical novelty. The last letter of the first edition (here 442) was addressed to his son Delio: \"... I feel a little tired and I can't write you much. You always write to me and everything that interests you in the school. I think you like the story, as I liked it when I was your age, because it concerns living men and everything that concerns men, as many men as possible, all men in the world as they unite with each other in society and they work and struggle and improve themselves you can't help but like it more than anything else. But it is so?\" Last but not least, Letters from the prison is a founding book of the Einaudi publishing house and of the generations that have followed one another to interpret it over the years and eras. The intention and the \"position\" of the Letters, like few other books, make the publishing house, including that last question, an essential step in Antonio Gramsci's thought: \"But is it so?\"\"",

This cultural obliteration is made possible by the negation of national reality, by new legal relations introduced by the occupying power, by the banishment of the natives and their customs to outlying districts by colonial society, by expropriation, and by the systematic enslaving of men and women.\nThree years ago at our first congress I showed that, in the colonial situation, dynamism is replaced fairly quickly by a substantification of the attitudes of the colonising power. The area of culture is then marked off by fences and signposts. These are in fact so many defence mechanisms of the most elementary type, comparable for more than one good reason to the simple instinct for preservation. The interest of this period for us is that the oppressor does not manage to convince himself of the objective non-existence of the oppressed nation and its culture. Every effort is made to bring the colonised person to admit the inferiority of his culture which has been transformed into instinctive patterns of behaviour, to recognise the unreality of his \u2018nation\u2019, and, in the last extreme, the confused and imperfect character of his own biological structure.\"",

A landmark text for revolutionaries and activists, The Wretched of the Earth is an eternal touchstone for civil rights, anti-colonialism, psychiatric studies, and Black consciousness movements around the world. Alongside Cornel West\u2019s introduction, the book features critical essays by Jean-Paul Sartre and Homi K. Bhabha.

He distinguishes between culture as a concept, culture as a structure and culture as praxis and analyzes the different ways in which culture has been used in each of these settings. For Bauman, culture is a living, changing aspect of human interaction which must be understood and studied as a universal of human life. At the heart of his approach is the proposition that culture is inherently ambivalent. With a major new introduction to this new edition, this classic work emerges as a crucial link in the development of Bauman's thought.

Unpacking the social roots and social consequences of globalizing processes, this book disperses some of the mist that surrounds the term.\nAlongside the emerging planetary dimensions of business, finance, trade and information flow, a 'localizing', space-fixing process is set in motion. What appears as globalization for some, means localization for many others; signalling new freedom for some, globalizing processes appear as uninvited and cruel fate for many others. Freedom to move, a scarce and unequally distributed commodity, quickly becomes the main stratifying factor of our times.\nNeo-tribal and fundamentalist tendencies are as legitimate offspring of globalization as the widely acclaimed 'hybridization' of top culture - the culture at the globalized top. A particular reason to worry is the progressive breakdown in communication between the increasingly global and extra- territorial elites and ever more 'localized' majority. The bulk of the population, the 'new middle class', bears the brunt of these problems, and suffers uncertainty, anxiety and fear as a result.\nThis book is a major contribution to the unfolding debate about globalization, and as such will be of interest to students and professionals in sociology, human geography and cultural issues.\"",

This passage, he argues, has brought profound change to all aspects of the human condition. The new remoteness and un-reachability of global systemic structure coupled with the unstructured and under-defined, fluid state of the immediate setting of life-politics and human togetherness, call for the rethinking of the concepts and cognitive frames used to narrate human individual experience and their joint history.\nThis book is dedicated to this task. Bauman selects five of the basic concepts which have served to make sense of shared human life - emancipation, individuality, time/space, work and community - and traces their successive incarnations and changes of meaning.\nLiquid Modernity concludes the analysis undertaken in Bauman's two previous books Globalization: The Human Consequences and In Search of Politics. Together these volumes form a brilliant analysis of the changing conditions of social and political life by one of the most original thinkers writing today.\"",

It is an unavoidable side-effect of economic progress and the quest for order which is characteristic of modernity.\nAs long as large parts of the world remained wholly or partly unaffected by modernization, they were treated by modernizing societies as lands that were able to absorb the excess of population in the \u2018developed countries\u2019. Global solutions were sought, and temporarily found, to locally produced overpopulation problems. But as modernization has reached the furthest lands of the planet, \u2018redundant population\u2019 is produced everywhere and all localities have to bear the consequences of modernity\u2019s global triumph. They are now confronted with the need to seek \u2013 in vain, it seems \u2013 local solutions to globally produced problems. The global spread of the modernity has given rise to growing quantities of human beings who are deprived of adequate means of survival, but the planet is fast running out of places to put them. Hence the new anxieties about \u2018immigrants\u2019 and \u2018asylum seekers\u2019 and the growing role played by diffuse \u2018security fears\u2019 on the contemporary political agenda.\nWith characteristic brilliance, this new book by Zygmunt Bauman unravels the impact of this transformation on our contemporary culture and politics and shows that the problem of coping with \u2018human waste\u2019 provides a key for understanding some otherwise baffling features of our shared life, from the strategies of global domination to the most intimate aspects of human relationships.\"",

But today Europe is unsure of itself and its place in a fast-changing world; it is devoid of vision, limited in resources and lacking the will to pursue its vocation. It is also struggling with the consequences of a one-sided process of globalization which is divorcing power from politics, inciting the shift from the social state to security-focused governance and piling up the casualties of uncontrolled market expansion and the ethically blind commercialization of human life.\nBauman argues that despite the odds Europe still has much to offer in dealing with the great challenges that face us in the twenty-first century. Through sharing its own hard-won historical lessons, Europe can play a vital role in moving from the Hobbesian-like world in which we find ourselves today towards the kind of peaceful unification of humanity that was once envisioned by Kant.\"",

Liquid life is also shot through by a contradiction: it ought to be a (possibly unending) series of new beginnings, yet precisely for that reason it is full of worries about swift and painless endings, without which new beginnings would be unthinkable. Among the arts of liquid-modern living and the skills needed to practice them, getting rid of things takes precedence over their acquisition.This and other challenges of life in a liquid-modern society are traced and unravelled in the successive chapters of this new book by one of the most brilliant and original social thinkers of our time.\"",

But in our contemporary liquid-modern world, culture has lost its missionary role and has become a means of seduction: it seeks no longer to enlighten the people but to seduce them. The function of culture today is not to satisfy existing needs but to create new ones, while simultaneously ensuring that existing needs remain permanently unfulfilled. Culture today likens itself to a giant department store where the shelves are overflowing with desirable goods that are changed on a daily basis - just long enough to stimulate desires whose gratification is perpetually postponed.In this new book, Zygmunt Bauman - one of the most brilliant and influential social thinkers of our time - retraces the peregrinations of the concept of culture and examines its fate in a world marked by the powerful new forces of globalization, migration and the intermingling of populations. He argues that Europe has a particularly important role to play in revitalizing our understanding of culture, precisely because Europe, with its great diversity of peoples, languages and histories, is the space where the Other is always one's neighbour and where each is constantly called upon to learn from everyone else.\"",

But while we have lost our faith in utopias of all hues, the human aspiration that made this vision so compelling has not died. Instead it is re-emerging today as a vision focused not on the future but on the past, not on a future-to-be-created but on an abandoned and undead past that we could call retrotopia.\nThe emergence of retrotopia is interwoven with the deepening gulf between power and politics that is a defining feature of our contemporary liquid-modern world\u2014the gulf between the ability to get things done and the capability of deciding what things need to be done, a capability once vested with the territorially sovereign state. This deepening gulf has rendered nation-states unable to deliver on their promises, giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen. True to the utopian spirit, retrotopia derives its stimulus from the urge to rectify the failings of the present human condition\u2014though now by resurrecting the failed and forgotten potentials of the past. Imagined aspects of the past, genuine or putative, serve as the main landmarks today in drawing the road-map to a better world. Having lost all faith in the idea of building an alternative society of the future, many turn instead to the grand ideas of the past, buried but not yet dead. Such is retrotopia, the contours of which are examined by Zygmunt Bauman in this sharp dissection of our contemporary romance with the past.\"",

This connection is nowhere more apparent than in the work of Zygmunt Bauman.  His conception and practice of sociology were always infused with a literary and artistic sensibility.  He wrote extensively on the relationship between sociology and the arts, and especially on sociology and literature; he frequently drew on literary writers in his exploration and elucidation of sociological problems; and he was an avid and passionate consumer and practitioner of art, especially film and photography.This volume brings together hitherto unknown or rare pieces by Bauman on the themes of culture and art, including previously unpublished material from the Bauman Archive at the University of Leeds.  A substantial introduction by the editors provides readers with a lucid guide through this material and develops connections to Bauman\u2019s other works.The first volume in a series of books that will make available the lesser-known writings of one of the most influential social thinkers of our time, Culture and Art will be of interest to students and scholars across the arts, humanities and social sciences, and to a wider readership.\"",

Q. Even though your publications and research interests have covered a wide range of sociological fields over the years, we do nonetheless see you as having a distinctive and continuing intellectual personality. We see you broadly as a humanistic Marxist, interested in culture, a kind of critical theorist; and there also seems to be a continuing theme of rejection of system in your work. Can you comment on these suggestions? Are we on the right track here? A. Well, I'm not a good judge of these matters because what you are proposing has hardly any structure. Your proposal is to take a number of objective categories and to ask me to situate myself, in a sense, objectively and externally, as an outsider, in relation to myself, in these objective categories. Now this is not a performance in which the person in question is the best performer. It is something which is much better done precisely\u2026\"",

Stuart Hall's \u2018Encoding and Decoding in Television Discourse\u2019 (University of Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, Stencilled Paper no. 7, 1973) was highly influential in developing a cultural analysis of media forms that was not based in the concept of the circulation circuit or the loop. Hall argued that moments of encoding and decoding are \u2018determinate moments\u2019 (original italics), so that raw historical events are not simply transmitted by the television newscast: \u2018Events can only be signified within the aural-visual forms of the televisual discourse\u2019. As Hall puts it, an event must become a \u2018story\u2019 before it becomes a communicative event. This emphasis on the structuring of the media form highlighted the role of the media in constructing sport discourse and narratives, not merely relaying the action from the site of the live action to the viewer.

Who is this emergent, new subject of the cinema? From where does it speak? The practices of representation always implicate the positions from which we speak or write \u2013 the positions of enunciation. What recent theories of enunciation suggest is that, though we speak, to say \u2018in our own name\u2019, of ourselves and from our own experience, nevertheless who speaks, and the subject who is spoken of, are never exactly in the same place. Identity is not as transparent or unproblematic as we think. Perhaps, instead of thinking of identity as an already accomplished historical fact, which the new cinematic discourses then represent, we should think, instead, of identity as a \u2018production\u2019, which is never complete, always in process, and always constituted within, not outside, representation. But this view problematizes the very authority and authenticity to which the term, \u2018cultural identity\u2019, lays claim. In this paper, then, I seek to open a dialogue, an investigation, on the subject of cultural identity and cinematic representation.\u201d",

In my view, Gramsci\u2019s work does not offer a general social science which can be applied to the analysis of social phenomena across a wide comparative range of historical societies. His potential contribution is more limited. It remains, for all that, of seminal importance. His work is, precisely, of a \u2018sophisticating\u2019 kind. He works, broadly, within the marxist paradigm. However, he has extensively revised, renovated and sophisticated many aspects of that theoretical framework to make it more relevant to contemporary social relations in the twentieth century. His work therefore has a direct bearing on the question of the \u2018adequacy\u2019 of existing social theories, since it is precisely in the direction of \u2018complexifying existing theories and problems\u2019 that his most important theoretical contribution is to be found. These points require further clarification before a substantive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and assessment of Gramsci\u2019s theoretical contribution can be offered.\"",

If post-colonial time is the time after colonialism, and colonialism is defined in terms of the binary division between the colonisers and the colonized, why is post-colonial time also a time of \u2018difference? What sort of \u2018difference\u2019 is this and what are its implications for the forms of politics and for subject formation in this late-modern moment? These questions increasingly haunt the contested space in which the concept of the \u2018post-colonial\u2019 now operates and they cannot be satisfactorily explored until we know more about what the concept means and why it has become the bearer of such powerful unconscious investments \u2013 a sign of desire for some, and equally for others, a signifier of danger.\u201d",

I\u2019m not at all sure about \u2018world citizenship\u2019. What I would say is that nowadays the concept is very closely related to globalisation. We are obliged to talk about the interdependencies across the globe in a planetary way, in which more or less everybody is in the swim of history and connected with one another. Of course, connected in deeply unequal ways \u2013 globalisation is a contradictory system, the product of what used to be called \u2018combined and uneven development\u2019. \"",

As chair of both inIVA and Autograph ABP, Stuart played an integral role in realizing this vision of a publcia space dedicated to creativity and diversity. The \u00a33 million building, designed by architect David Adjaye, offers a place to exhibit art but it also provides a home for idea, thought and reflection upon the relevance of difference to the visual arts. A few weeks after its doors were opened officially, Rivington Place hosted the launch of Paul Gilroy\u2019s Black Britain: A Photographic History (2007). The book, planned initially to be a collaboration with Stuart Hall, portrays and documents the position or black people within British society through photographs drawn from the Getty Collection. Stuart\u2019s health prevented him from playing a full role in its completion, but he contributed a preface and at the launch he discussed the project with Paul Gilroy in front of an audience gathered to celebrate its publication.\u201d",

In a conversatin both intimate and sweeping in scope, Hall describes his migration from Jamaice to England, his immersion in left-wing politics in London, the influence of Raymond Williams and E.P. Thompson on the evolution of his thought, and the context within which the early classic texts of cultural studies was written. Hall also shares his pessimism about the economic recession and his optimism about Barack Obama\u2019s victory.

Distinguishing between \"origin,\" which is divine, mythical, and privileged, and \"beginning,\" which is secular and humanly produced, Said traces the ramifications and diverse understandings of the concept of beginning through history. A beginning is a first step in the intentional production of meaning and the production of difference from preexisting traditions. It authorizes subsequent texts\u2014it both enables them and limits what is acceptable.\nDrawing on the insights of Vico, Valery, Nietzsche, Saussure, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Husserl, and Foucault, Said recognizes the novel as the major attempt in Western literary culture to give beginnings an authorizing function in experience, art, and knowledge. Scholarship should see itself as a beginning\u2014as a uniting of theory and practice. Said's insistence on a criticism that is humane and socially responsible is what makes Beginnings a book about much more than writing: it is about imagination and action as well as the constraints on freedom and invention that come from human intention and the method of its fulfillment.\"",

            "description": "\"This extraordinarily wide-ranging work represents a new departure for contemporary literary theory. Author of Beginnings and the controversial Orientalism, Edward Said demonstrates that modern critical discourse has been impressively strengthened by the writings of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, for example, and by such influences as Marxism, structuralism, linguistics, and psychoanalysis. He argues, however, that the various methods and schools have had a crippling effect through their tendency to force works of literature to meet the requirements of a theory or system, ignoring the complex affiliations binding the texts to the world.\nThe critic must maintain a distance both from critical systems and from the dogmas and orthodoxies of the dominant culture, Said contends. He advocates freedom of consciousness and responsiveness to history, to the exigencies of the text, to political, social, and human values, to the heterogeneity of human experience. These characteristics are brilliantly exemplified in his own analyses of individual authors and works.\nCombining the principles and practice of criticism, the book offers illuminating investigations of a number of writers\u2014Swift, Conrad, Luk\u00e1cs, Renan, and many others\u2014and of concepts such as repetition, originality, worldliness, and the roles of audiences, authors, and speakers. It asks daring questions, investigates problems of urgent significance, and gives a subtle yet powerful new meaning to the enterprise of criticism in modern society.\"",

            "description": "\"Culture and Imperialism is a nonfiction book published in 1993 by the Palestinian American author and academic Edward Said. Originating from a series of lectures that Said delivered in 1985 and 1986, Culture and Imperialism is an expansion of the ideas set out in his groundbreaking earlier work, Orientalism. Considered one of the founders of the field of post-colonial studies, Said looks at how the formerly colonized margins influence the metropolitan centers, and vice versa. He argues that the project of imperialism undergirds virtually every interaction between the West and the rest of the world. The exchanges between Britain and India, France and Algeria, and America and everywhere else (as the world\u2019s last superpower, in Said\u2019s view) provide him with cogent points of analysis. In what was a radical idea at the time, he also posits that culture itself bolsters the project of imperialism in ways both obvious and subtle, and that culture and imperialism are inextricably linked in myriad ways. He is especially concerned with the novel and other literary cultural products, revealing how works seemingly removed from the process of colonialism are actually intimately connected to it. Ultimately, Said lays the groundwork for a truly post-imperial world that moves beyond nationalism and essentialist notions of identity to a migratory kind of liberation from these authoritative narratives. He believes that the function of the scholar, or the public intellectual, is to actively engage with the real world to establish a more equitable discourse without the use of conventional prejudice which gives rise to the inevitable conflicts that are the hallmark of imperialism.

As these collected essays amply prove, he is also our most intelligent and bracingly heretical writer on affairs involving not only Palestinians but also the Arab and Muslim worlds and their tortuous relations with the West.\nIn The Politics of Dispossession Said traces his people's struggle for statehood through twenty-five years of exile, from the PLO's bloody 1970 exile from Jordan through the debacle of the Gulf War and the ambiguous 1994 peace accord with Israel. As frank as he is about his personal involvement in that struggle, Said is equally unsparing in his demolition of Arab icons and American shibboleths.

            "description": "\"With their powerful blend of political and aesthetic concerns, Edward W. Said\u2019s writings have transformed the field of literary studies. This long-awaited collection of literary and cultural essays, the first since Harvard University Press published The World, the Text, and the Critic in 1983, reconfirms what no one can doubt\u2014that Said is the most impressive, consequential, and elegant critic of our time\u2014and offers further evidence of how much the fully engaged critical mind can contribute to the reservoir of value, thought, and action essential to our lives and our culture.\nAs in the title essay, the widely admired \u201cReflections on Exile,\u201d the fact of his own exile and the fate of the Palestinians have given both form and the force of intimacy to the questions Said has pursued. Taken together, these essays\u2014from the famous to those that will surprise even Said\u2019s most assiduous followers\u2014afford rare insight into the formation of a critic and the development of an intellectual vocation. Said\u2019s topics are many and diverse, from the movie heroics of Tarzan to the machismo of Ernest Hemingway to the shades of difference that divide Alexandria and Cairo. He offers major reconsiderations of writers and artists such as George Orwell, Giambattista Vico, Georg Lukacs, R. P. Blackmur, E. M. Cioran, Naguib Mahfouz, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, Walter Lippman, Samuel Huntington, Antonio Gramsci, and Raymond Williams. Invigorating, edifying, acutely attentive to the vying pressures of personal and historical experience, his book is a source of immeasurable intellectual delight.\"",

            "description": "\"Nadine Gordimer once wrote, referring to Edward Said\u2019s memoir Out of Place, \u201cSaid is in place among the truly important intellects in our century.\u201d These forty-six eloquent and impassioned essays written by Said between December 2000 and July 2003 for the London-based Al-Hayat, Cairo\u2019s Al-Ahram Weekly, and the London Review of Books underscore his tireless efforts for the Palestinian cause. They take us from the collapse of the Oslo Accords to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, focusing on three main themes, as Tony Judt points out in his introduction: the urgent need to reveal the truth about Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, the equally urgent need to get Palestinians and other Arabs to engage with the progressive elements in Israel, and the need to speak out about the failure of Arab leadership.\nIn From Oslo to Iraq and the Road Map, Said writes about the second intifada and about the so-called peace process, which he terms a kind of \u201cfast-food peace\u201d underscored by \u201cmalevolent sloppiness.\u201d He discusses the breach of democracy in the last American presidential election and describes the Bush administration as hopeless in its allegiance to the Christian right and to the big oil companies. He writes passionately against the war in Iraq and condemns the \u201croad map\u201d as a plan not for peace but for pacification of the Palestinians. He makes clear the ways in which the U.S. response to 9/11 has further destabilized the Middle East, but finds as well reasons for hope: the Palestinian National Initiative, an organization of grassroots activists who share a burgeoning idea of democracy \u201cundreamed of by the [Palestinian] Authority.\u201d What has always set Said apart is his ability to state the uncensored truth about the realities of the Palestinian experience, from land expropriation, and dispossession, to assassinations, roadblocks, and house demolitions.\nIn this book, Said reveals information that never finds its way into the American media, thus providing a real context for our understanding of the Middle East. Fiercely uncompromising, written with clarity and elegance, From Oslo to Iraq and the Road Map gives us an essential and unique voice that is more important now than ever before.\"",

            "title": "Humanism and Democratic Criticism (Publisher: Columbia University Press)", 
            "description": "\"In the radically changed and highly charged political atmosphere that has overtaken the United States\u2014and to varying degrees the rest of the world\u2014since September 11, 2001, the notion that cultures can harmoniously and productively coexist has come to seem like little more than a quaint fiction. In this time of heightened animosity and aggression, have humanistic values and democratic principles become irrelevant? Are they merely utopian fantasies? Or are they now more urgent and necessary than ever before?\nEver since the ascendancy of critical theory and multicultural studies in the 1960s and 1970s, traditional humanistic education has been under assault. Often condemned as the intolerant voice of the masculine establishment and regularly associated with Eurocentrism and even imperialism, the once-sacred literary canon is now more likely to be ridiculed than revered. While this seismic shift\u2014brought on by advances in technological communication, intellectual specialization, and cultural sensitivity\u2014has eroded the former primacy of the humanities, Edward Said argues that a more democratic form of humanism\u2014one that aims to incorporate, emancipate, and enlighten\u2014is still possible. A lifelong humanist, Said believed that self-knowledge is the highest form of human achievement and the true goal of humanistic education. But he also believed that self-knowledge is unattainable without an equal degree of self-criticism, or the awareness that comes from studying and experiencing other peoples, traditions, and ideas.\nProposing a return to philology and a more expansive literary canon as strategies for revitalizing the humanities, Said contends that words are not merely passive figures but vital agents in historical and political change. Intellectuals must reclaim an active role in public life, but at the same time, insularity and parochialism, as well as the academic trend toward needless jargon and obscurantism, must be combated. The \"humanities crisis,\" according to Said, is based on the misperception that there is an inexorable conflict between established traditions and our increasingly complex and diversified world. Yet this position fails to recognize that the canonized thinkers of today were the revolutionaries of yesterday and that the nature of human progress is to question, upset, and reform. By considering the emerging social responsibilities of writers and intellectuals in an ever more interdependent world and exploring the enduring influence of Eric Auerbach's critical masterpiece, Mimesis, Said not only makes a persuasive case for humanistic education but provides his own captivating and deeply personal perspective on our shared intellectual heritage.\"",

He helps us see how, though these works often stood in direct contrast to the tastes of society, they were, just as often, announcements of what was to come in the artist's discipline - works of true artistic genius.\"",

Narrating the resistance movement from a variety of perspectives\u2014from those of traditional wives to liberated students to political organizers\u2014Djebar powerfully depicts the circumstances that drive oppressed communities to violence and at the same time movingly reveals the tragic costs of war.\"",

Denounced in Algeria for its political criticism, Djebar's book quickly sold out its first printing of 15,000 copies in France and was hugely popular in Italy. Her stylistically innovative, lyrical stories address the cloistering of women, the implications of reticence, the connection of language to oppression, and the impact of war on both women and men.\"",

The tragedies of Algerian history are its subject\u2014particularly the condition of women in Islam.

She watches her marriage disintegrate in a society intolerant of women, even as she marvels at the closeness of women among themselves at the ritual baths and in other gatherings. Woven into the woman\u2019s personal life story is the ancient history of her land, including the loss of its early languages, the massive destruction suffered in wars of conquest, and the quirks of chance which enabled traces to remain.\nHere is a radically singular voice; a private tale embedded in a vast tapestry.\"",

            "description": "\"The modernity of racism and its relationship to contemporary capitalism.\nForty years after the defeat of Nazism, and twenty years after the great wave of decolonization, how is it that racism remains a growing phenomenon? What are the special characteristics of contemporary racism? How can it be related to class divisions and to the contradictions of the nation-state? And how far, in turn, does racism today compel us to rethink the relationship between class struggles and nationalism?\nThis book attempts to answer these fundamental questions through a remarkable dialogue between the French philosopher Etienne Balibar and the American historian and sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein. Each brings to the debate the fruits of over two decades of analytical work, greatly inspired, respectively, by Louis Althusser and Fernand Braudel. Both authors challenge the commonly held notion of racism as a continuation of, or throwback to, the xenophobias of past societies and communities. They analyze it instead as a social relation indissolubly tied to present social structures\u2014the nation-state, the division of labor, and the division between core and periphery\u2014which are themselves constantly being reconstructed. Despite their productive disagreements, Balibar and Wallerstein both emphasize the modernity of racism and the need to understand its relation to contemporary capitalism and class struggle. Above all, their dialogue reveals the forms of present and future social conflict, in a world where the crisis of the nation-state is accompanied by an alarming rise of nationalism and chauvinism.\"",

His work has been vastly influential on both sides of the Atlantic throughout the humanities and the social sciences. In We, the People of Europe?, he expands on themes raised in his previous works to offer a trenchant and eloquently written analysis of \u201ctransnational citizenship\u201d from the perspective of contemporary Europe. Balibar moves deftly from state theory, national sovereignty, and debates on multiculturalism and European racism, toward imagining a more democratic and less state-centered European citizenship.\nAlthough European unification has progressively divorced the concepts of citizenship and nationhood, this process has met with formidable obstacles. While Balibar seeks a deep understanding of this critical conjuncture, he goes beyond theoretical issues. For example, he examines the emergence, alongside the formal aspects of European citizenship, of a \u201cEuropean apartheid,\u201d or the reduplication of external borders in the form of \u201cinternal borders\u201d nurtured by dubious notions of national and racial identity. He argues for the democratization of how immigrants and minorities in general are treated by the modern democratic state, and the need to reinvent what it means to be a citizen in an increasingly multicultural, diversified world. A major new work by a renowned theorist, We, the People of Europe? offers a far-reaching alternative to the usual framing of multicultural debates in the United States while also engaging with these debates.\"",

He finds the tension between these different kinds of rights to be ingrained in the constitution of the modern nation-state and the contemporary welfare state. At the same time, he seeks to keep rights discourse open, eschewing natural entitlements in favor of a deterritorialized citizenship that could be expanded and invented anew in the age of globalization. Deeply engaged with other thinkers, including Arendt, Ranci\u00e8re, and Laclau, he posits a theory of the polity based on social relations.

With extraordinarily acute discernment, the leading philosopher \u00c9tienne Balibar examines one by one the various faces of this object, more numerous - and far more fissured - than one would imagine. The question of what it means to be a citizen has, from the dawn of Western politics, been anything but clear and straightforward; and modernity has shown it to be even more enigmatic and contested.Inseparable from democracy, and the demands for equality and liberty from which democracy draws its origins, citizenship is constantly being redefined within the unresolved contradiction between universal principles and the discriminatory mechanisms that regulate membership of a political community.Not everyone is a citizen, even within one nation-state. It has been said that ?certain persons are in society without being of society?. The dynamics of inclusion and exclusion continue to generate dramatic asymmetries and create openings and closures, especially today in a time of particular fragility and when national sovereignty is in flux. So are there too many antinomies within citizenship? Balibar does not shy away from these antimonies, but he knows that to renounce citizenship would be to abandon the chance to create new modes of collective autonomy, in short, to democratize democracy.\"",

This title considers the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this book, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as \u201cwe\u201d (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucault, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot). After the \u201chumanist controversy\u201d that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, the book proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a \u201cright to have rights\u201d (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. He\u2014or she, because the text is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual difference\u2014figures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding \u201canthropological differences\u201d that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community. The violence of \u201ccivil\u201d bourgeois universality, the text argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness.\"",

            "description": "\"What is the relationship between cosmopolitanism and secularism\u2014the worldwide and the worldly? While cosmopolitan politics may seem inherently secular, existing forms of secularism risk undermining the universality of cosmopolitanism because they privilege the European tradition over all others and transform particular historical norms into enunciations of truth, valid for all cultures and all epochs. In this book, the noted philosopher \u00c9tienne Balibar explores the tensions lurking at this troubled nexus in order to advance a truly democratic and emancipatory cosmopolitanism, which requires a secularization of secularism itself.\nBalibar argues for the idea of the universal against its particular dominant institutions. He questions the assumptions that underlie popular ideas of secularism and religion and outlines the importance of a new critique for the contemporary world. Balibar holds that conflicts between religious and secular discourses need to be reframed from a point of view that takes into account the cultural hybridization, migration and mobility, and transformation of borders that have reshaped the postcolonial age. Among the topics discussed are the uses and misuses of the category of religion and the religious, the paradoxical genealogy of monotheism, French la\u00efcit\u00e9\u2019s identitarian turn, and the implications of the responses to the Charlie Hebdo attacks for an extended definition of free speech. Going beyond circumscribed notions of religion and the public sphere, Secularism and Cosmopolitanism is a profound rethinking of identity and difference that seeks to make room for a renewed political imagination.\"",

Perhaps the limit was crossed some time ago, without becoming fully conscious, and this is like stating the obvious, but it remains necessary to elaborate the intellectual instruments which allow us collectively to understand in which moment and place \u2018we\u2019 live and struggle (and by \u2018we\u2019, here, I refer as a matter of principle to \u2018Europeans\u2019 defined as inhabitants, residents or even virtual residents of the continent, a definition which is broader and more ambiguous than the official constituency of this or that contingent system of nations, which is a political choice in the general sense without which we would have already precluded the possibilities of understanding). We need these intellectual instruments not only because as a general rule citizens who claim to be the actors of their own collective history need to decipher their conditions, \u2018interpret the world\u2019 in which they are situated in order to be able to \u2018transform it\u2019 in a definite manner (and to transform the world is inevitable, it is the mere effect of its internal conflictuality). But we need them because, in fact, the \u2018limit\u2019 (or the \u2018limits\u2019 in the plural) which we have reached (and probably crossed) have nothing to do with a linear or punctual threshold in the continuity of a development, the transition between one moment (or epoch) and another one of the \u2018same\u2019 history, whose orientation could be anticipated: in fact they coincide at the same time with radical uncertainty with respect to the possible outcomes, and with violent antagonism between the different possibilities, which has very little chance to remain a purely virtual one. But the way in which the situation is understood and explained, therefore the intellectual dimension of the latent conflicts, is itself a crucial aspect of the configuration, the shaping of the historical alternatives. Who stands where, and for what, is extremely unclear, and therefore open for antithetic \u2018clarifications\u2019, which intertwine the theoretical and the political. And the more ruthless the political constraints appear to be, the more uncompromising the theoretical work of inquiry and discussion should remain.\"",

I will submit that Said's meditation of the perpetual dis-placement of the post-colonial subject, involving fidelity and projection, exile and translation, performs a radical metamorphosis of that category, which is not so much framed as \"double consciousness\" (as in Du Bois and Fanon) than \"transposition\" and \"paraphrase\" of the dominant theme (as in musical elaboration). The border thus becomes at the same time sharpened, densified, and lost. With the help of this assumption, returning to some of my preferred texts of engagement and criticism in his work, I will try to explain how it was possible for him, not only to combine a merciless critique of the codes of imperialism with a deep commitment to the tradition of secular humanism, but to open the path towards a new understanding of the cultural time-space in which we are entering.\"",

            "description": "\"The article addresses the problem of equivalences that will be used to translate into Dutch literary texts written in ordinary African English (Black English Vernacular -BEV). American-African literary production is so rich \u2014 an affirmation which applies both to the past (e.g. the Harlem Renaissance) but more particularly to what we know today \u2014 that it is urgent to know what variety of Dutch is the most appropriate, logical and credible equivalent for translating the BEV. The damage that the Dutch translation has caused to certain literary works written in BEV is enormous. Translators of black US idioms and culture generally show a lack of understanding and often randomly opt for social or regional Dutch dialects that are deemed to be linguistically and stylistically equivalent. The central thesis developed in this article is based on linguistic but also socio-cultural foundations to state that it is the dialect spoken by Black Surinamese, namely Surinamese Dutch (NS), which constitutes the equivalent of BEV. Black Surinamese are the migrating companions of North Americans of African descent; they are part of the same black diaspora. The common history of NS and BEV was recorded. The authors have analyzed the characteristics of NS and BEV and argue that these two dialects, comparable to Creole, present a whole series of common elements which have not yet been explored. Furthermore, they believe that it can be postulated that African Americans and African Surinamese share a common socio-cultural heritage. A case study, in this case the Dutch translation of Alice Walker's novel 'The Color Purple', demonstrates how the text translated into NS \"sticks\" to the BEV.\"",

The cultural archive (after Said) to be passed on should be transnational, intersectional, interdisciplinary, relational and reflexive. In particular, the author focuses on processes and practices of racialization as they impact on and are practised within the discipline. In the current backlash against feminism and women\u2019s studies in different parts of Europe, frequently divisionary tactics are deployed, by which women are pitted against each other, based on assumed immutable differences which are conceived of as either \u2018raciological\u2019 (after Gilroy), ethnicized or as cultural, in such a way that \u2018race\u2019 enters again through the back door. The author argues that we need a European brand of feminism that is not complicit with the legacies of modernity, which continue to construct \u2018race\u2019. That is, we should be deeply concerned with thinking through the parameters of a viable anti-racist European women\u2019s studies. By analysing various case studies, taken from the everyday Dutch reality at the beginning of this new millennium, the author shows the necessity and inescapability of the feminism she advocates.\"",

Wekker analyzes the Dutch media's portrayal of black women and men, the failure to grasp race in the Dutch academy, contemporary conservative politics (including gay politicians espousing anti-immigrant rhetoric), and the controversy surrounding the folkloric character Black Pete, showing how the denial of racism and the expression of innocence safeguards white privilege. Wekker uncovers the postcolonial legacy of race and its role in shaping the white Dutch self, presenting the contested, persistent legacy of racism in the country.\"",

Een Nederland, dat ons\nwervend voorgehouden wordt als vrij, tolerant en een baken van beschaving in het\nons omringende tij van barbarij. De verleiding is te groot om nu niet de uitspraak van\nJan Peter Balkenende bij de begrotingsbesprekingen van 2006 aan te halen, toen hij\nverzuchtte dat wij, Nederlanders, weer een VOC \u2013mentaliteit zouden moeten\nontwikkelen: \u201cNederland kan het weer. Die VOC-mentaliteit van over grenzen\nheenkijken. Dynamiek!! Toch\u201d? Olijk keek hij ons daarbij aan, zelfingenomen met dit\nsprekende beeld, waarmee hij tegelijkertijd en ongewild zoveel prijs gaf van het\nverborgen Nederlandse culturele archief. Van de prins geen kwaad\u2026. Maar hij is de\nenige niet die lijdt aan verlangen naar vroeger. Er is nostalgie naar een tijd dat religie\nvrijwel uit het publieke domein verdwenen was en naar het autonome, neo-liberale\nZelf dat vanaf toen geconstrueerd kon worden; er is nostalgie naar de vijftiger jaren\ntoen Nederland, qua bevolkingssamenstelling, nog gewoon onproblematisch wit\nwas, en de gender verhoudingen nog duidelijk.\"",

Through impromptu artworks, lectures, readings, discussions, screenings, performances, and explorations of the assembly\u2014of being together\u2014as an art form, Propositions #1: What We Mean practices art as thought and action intervening in the contemporary.\nIn this lecture, Gloria Wekker investigates what it means to cultivate and live in intimate relationships that do not repeat fascist patterns; as in power-hungry or, on the contrary, power-evasive patterns. Struck by contrasting patterns in United States and Dutch interracial relationships, she gives a brief overview of the historical differences and commonalities. Whereas in the US such relationships, especially those between black and white people, are relatively recent and rare, such mixed relationships are much more frequent in the Netherlands. What does that mean? Does it mean that we are beyond race, post-race here?

Its main force stems from the lack of coherent opposition. Too many people are frightened off by accusations: \u2018racialist\u2019, \u2018elitist\u2019 or simply \u2018old-fashioned\u2019, which make cowards of nearly all.\u201d\nChapter 4: \u201cPolice and thieves\u201d\nAbstract: \u201cThe uprisings of July 1981 and subsequent discussion of police tactics and orientation have focused critical attention on the relationship between police and the communities in which they are standard bearers for the law. Police malpractice has fuelled intense debates, particularly in Liverpool and Manchester, over the status of police committees and their powers under Section 4 of the 1964 Police Act. These developments have shifted the issue of police/black relations nearer to the centre of the stage on which the drama of civil liberties unfolds. Conflict between black people and the police, however, predates these recent eruptions, and it is regrettable that civil liberties campaigning betrays real ignorance of the history of this difficult relationship. Few of those who recoiled in horror as petrol bombs flew in Brixton can have been familiar with the saga of local \u2018community relations\u2019 in which these \u2018riots\u2019 were only the latest episode.\u201d\nChapter 8: \u201cSteppin\u2019 out of Babylon\u2014race, class and autonomy\u201d\nAbstract: \u201cThe communists have a long time ahead of them before they can do anything for themselves in this country. When they get there we will be for them. But meantime we are for ourselves. - Marcus Garvey\nSocialism is not a fixed unchanging doctrine. As the world develops, people\u2019s insight increases and as new relations come into being, there arise new methods of achieving our goal.\u201d",

            "description": "\"To the forces of cultural nationalism hunkered down in their camps, this bold book sounds a liberating call. There is, Paul Gilroy tells us, a culture that is not specifically African, American, Caribbean, or British, but all of these at once, a black Atlantic culture whose themes and techniques transcend ethnicity and nationality to produce something new and, until now, unremarked. Challenging the practices and assumptions of cultural studies, The Black Atlantic also complicates and enriches our understanding of modernism.\nDebates about postmodernism have cast an unfashionable pall over questions of historical periodization. Gilroy bucks this trend by arguing that the development of black culture in the Americas arid Europe is a historical experience which can be called modern for a number of clear and specific reasons. For Hegel, the dialectic of master and slave was integral to modernity, and Gilroy considers the implications of this idea for a transatlantic culture. In search of a poetics reflecting the politics and history of this culture, he takes us on a transatlantic tour of the music that, for centuries, has transmitted racial messages and feeling around the world, from the Jubilee Singers in the nineteenth century to Jimi Hendrix to rap. He also explores this internationalism as it is manifested in black writing from the \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d of W. E. B. Du Bois to the \u201cdouble vision\u201d of Richard Wright to the compelling voice of Toni Morrison.\nIn a final tour de force, Gilroy exposes the shared contours of black and Jewish concepts of diaspora in order both to establish a theoretical basis for healing rifts between blacks and Jews in contemporary culture and to further define the central theme of his book: that blacks have shaped a nationalism, if not a nation, within the shared culture of the black Atlantic.\"",

He compels us to see that fascism was the principal political innovation of the twentieth century - and that its power to seduce did not die in a bunker in Berlin.\nBetween Camps addresses questions such as:\n* Why do we still divide humanity into different identity groups based on skin colour?\n* Did all the good done by the Civil Rights Movement and the decolonization of the Third World have such little lasting effect?\nGilroy examines the ways in which media and commodity culture have become pre-eminent in our lives in the years since the 1960s and especially in the 1980s with the rise of hip-hop and other militancies. With this trend, he contends, much that was valuable about black culture has been sacrificed in the service of corporate interests and new forms of cultural expression tied to visual technologies. He argues that the triumph of the image spells death to politics and reduces people to mere symbols.\nAt its heart, Between Camps is a Utopian project calling for the renunciation of race. Gilroy champions a new humanism, global and cosmopolitan, and he offers a new political language and a new moral vision for what was once called 'anti-racism'.\"",

He then takes the liberal discourse of human rights to task, finding it wanting in terms of both racism and imperialism. Gilroy examines how this imperial dissolution has resulted not only in hostility directed at blacks, immigrants and strangers, but also in the country's inability to value the ordinary, unruly multi-culturalism that has evolved organically and unnoticed in its urban centres.\nA must-read for students of cultural studies, and Britain in the post 9/11 era.\"",

At a time of economic crisis, environmental degradation, ongoing warfare, and heated debate over human rights, how should we reassess the changing place of black culture?\nGilroy considers the ways that consumerism has diverted African Americans\u2019 political and social aspirations. Luxury goods and branded items, especially the automobile\u2014rich in symbolic value and the promise of individual freedom\u2014have restratified society, weakened citizenship, and diminished the collective spirit. Jazz, blues, soul, reggae, and hip hop are now seen as generically American, yet artists like Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, and Bob Marley, who questioned the allure of mobility and speed, are not understood by people who have drained their music of its moral power.\nGilroy explores the way in which objects and technologies can become dynamic social forces, ensuring black culture\u2019s global reach while undermining the drive for equality and justice. Drawing on the work of a number of thinkers, including Michel Foucault, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, and Frantz Fanon, he examines the ethical dimensions of living in a society that celebrates the object. What are the implications for our notions of freedom?\nWith his brilliant, provocative analysis and astonishing range of reference, Gilroy revitalizes the study of African American culture. He traces the shifting character of black intellectual and social movements, and shows how we can construct an account of moral progress that reflects today\u2019s complex realities.\"",

As ailing capitalism emancipates itself from democratic regulation, ultra-nationalism, populism, xenophobia and varieties of neo-fascism have become more visible, more assertive and more corrosive of political culture. The widespread appeal of racialised group identity and racism, often conveyed obliquely with a knowing wink, has been instrumental in delivering us to a situation in which our conceptions of truth, law and government have been placed in jeopardy. In many places, pathological hunger for national rebirth and the restoration of an earlier political time, have combined with resentful, authoritarian and belligerent responses to alterity and the expectation of hospitality.\"",

In this respect, this volume does not represent a uniform position on postcolonial theory, but provides an insight into the range of discussions and practices surrounding postcoloniality in the German-speaking context. Above all, however, the volume sheds light on the effects that postcolonial concepts have on understanding and transforming the reality of migrants and members of minorities in post-reunification Germany - a reality that has been shaped by the massive increase in racist and anti-Semitic violence in a post-Nazi society is embossed.

It is only since the twentieth century, however, that Germans of African descent have been perceived as a group. This did not lead to their recognition as a national minority, but rather, from the 1910s to the 1960s, they were defined as a collective threat to Germany's racial and cultural \u2018purity\u2019. When a sense of identity emerged among Afro-Germans themselves in the 1980s, the majority population continued to deny the existence of ethnic diversity within German society. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Afro-Germans seemingly suddenly appeared as a new, \u2018hip\u2019 minority. This appearance was largely focused on the immense public success of the Hip Hop collective \u2018Brothers Keepers\u2019, conceived as an anti-racist, explicitly Afro-German intervention into German debates around national identity and racist violence. This article explains the success of \u2018Brothers Keepers\u2019 by contextualising it within the tradition of two decades of Afro- German feminist activism and the transnational Hip Hop movement of European youth of colour.\"",

Maintaining that this is a Europe-wide phenomenon, the article looks at Amsterdam as exemplifying the European metropole as a site of pseudo-homophile Islamophobia.

This regime is currently most evident in discourses around the nation's Muslim communities as living in ostensibly archaic, anti-modern \u201cparallel societies.\u201d Using the trope of travel narratives and their employment of gender and sexuality, I trace the epistemological placement of \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cMuslim\u201d as mutually exclusive opposites and end by proposing that this (dis)placement is not only a source of exclusion but also potentially the means by which alternative spatio-temporal models emerge that defy this opposition and the social logic behind it.\"",

            "description": "\"Our joint intervention explores Queer People of Colour (QpoC) positionalities as a valuable\nlens through which to rethink the racial and colonial imaginaries of subjects and space in\nEurope. It brings together race, gender, class, colonialism and sexuality, inseparably, in a\nshared analytic. We address multiple erasures: of genders, sexualities and race from\ndiscussions of space; of QPoC in Europe from discussions of European subjects, race and\nspace; and from US-centric QPoC studies. Europeans are generally presumed to be\nhomogeneously white, while racialized subjects are generally presumed to be uniformly\nstraight and cis. Rarely is space understood as a formation that is co-constituted through\nsexualities with other relations of power. Our intervention radically rethinks urban\nenvironments in their relation to race, subjects and agencies. It also puts QPoC in Europe\non the map. We recognize that the categories \u2018queer\u2019 and \u2018of colour\u2019 are contingent, contested and unfinished. They tend to reinforce US-centricity and to erase differences within and across\ngender and sexually non-conforming, racialized and colonized collectivities across the\nGlobal North and the South. The term \u2018people of colour\u2019 often travels to Europe in ways\nthat keep Europe white and the US hegemonic, and dismiss local antiracist and antiimperialist struggles as inauthentic and derivative. Similarly, \u2018queer\u2019 often circulates in\nways that universalize white colonial genders and sexualities, while erasing all others,\nincluding the working-class dykes of colour in the U.S. described by Gloria Anzaldu\u00b4a\n(1991, 2007), for whom queer was an important alternative to homonormative identifiers\n(Bacchetta, 2002; Bacchetta, Falquet and Alarcon, 2012). The assimilation of \u2018queer\u2019 (and\noften \u2018queer of colour\u2019) into white-dominated academic formations in Europe has done\nnothing to contest how racialized people are inscribed as deficient, inferior and disentitled\nto life chances on account of their failed masculinities, femininities and heterosexualities\n(El-Tayeb, 2003; Haritaworn, 2005). Instead, it unproblematically coincides with the\nincreased criminalization, pathologization, displacement, and/or spatial confinement of\nracialized populations.\"",

Using the 2015 refugee crisis as a focal point and centering the German example, the author explores the complex relationship between memory discourses and visions of Germany\u2019s and Europe\u2019s postunification future. The author argues that the erasure of colonial violence from the continent\u2019s collective memory has a direct, negative impact on its ability to let go of a racialized identity that is in increasing tension with Europe\u2019s actual multiracial and multireligious composition. The article traces this dynamic around the example of the non-European collections in Berlin\u2019s Museum Island and the future Humboldt Forum, conceptualized as the world\u2019s largest \u201cuniversal museum.\u201d The narratives through which this art is integrated into Europe\u2019s cultural heritage are in stark contrast to those that simultaneously defined the refugees, who arrived from the same region in which the art originated, as fundamentally different and threatening. The narratives intersect in the Multaqa initiative, which offers Arab language tours of Museum Island to refugees, and in the controversy around the site of the Humboldt Forum and the colonial art it is meant to house.\"",

            "description": "\"Fatima El-Tayeb collaborated with director Angelina Maccarone in writing the script for the feature film Everything Will Be Fine (Alles wird gut, 1997), for which they received a grant from the state of SchleswigHolstein in 1996. The film has won awards at the New Festival in New York, at Toronto's Inside Out, and at the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Los Angeles. Alles wird gut was published in book form by the Orlanda Frauenverlag in 1999. El-Tayeb is an Afro-German scholar who earned her doctorate in History from the University of Hamburg, where she wrote her dissertation entitled \"Black Germans and German Racism: Oxymoron or Repressed History: African Germans and the Discourse on 'Race,' 1900-1933.\" A revised version of this study, Schwarze Deutsche: Der Diskurs um \"Rasse\" und nationale Identit\u00e4t 1890-1933, has been published by Campus Verlag. El-Tayeb was the special guest at the 2001 Women in German conference in Rio Rico, Arizona. The interview was inspired by the discussion that followed the film screening there and took place via e-mail. Interview Barbara Kosta: You and Angelina Maccarone worked together to produce the script for Alles wird gut. Could you please talk about your collaboration ? How did the idea for thefilm develop? Fatima El-Tayeb: Angelina and I have been friends for a long time. While she was in the process of writing the script for her first movie Kommt Maust raus? [dir. Alexander Scherer, 1994; Is Mausi Coming Out?!], we talked a lot about it and realized that we would probably work very well together. The experience she had co-directing that first Women in German Yearbook 18 (2002) 32Interview with Fatima El-Tayeb movie was not very pleasant. Angelina was a newcomer and she was confronted full force with the power games in the film industry. The director and producer of Kommt Mausi raus? (for those who have seen Everything Will Be Fine, the character of the fish, Frau M\u00fcller, is based on the producer) went out of their way to put Angelina in \"her place. \" A particularly annoying aspect was that they refused to have one of the protagonists played by a black actress. They insisted that the casting of a black actress should have been made explicit in the script (of course, the script did not say anything about the character being white either). Angelina and I had talked before about writing a script together, but I think our idea to make a film with two black women in leading roles basically started then. The presence of black women on the screen is still extremely rare in mainstream films as well as in feminist/lesbian films, both in Germany and in the United States. The debates around racism in the lesbian community often resulted in the introduction of \"the black character.\" In these cases, the protagonist is either reduced to being black, which means that blackness is used to initiate a discussion on racism, or a black person is totally \"whitened,\" which means that she/he appears isolated in an otherwise white world with no connection to a community of color. We wanted our script to reflect the world that we actually were living in, an urban German scene that is not nearly as white as the media make it out to be. Our decision to cast two black women in leading roles had a lot to do with wanting to overcome this representation of blackness as a single and self-sufficient marker. Our initial idea was to create a situation in which two extremely different people are thrown together and these two characters would be both black and female. Originally we intended to make a road movie, because that genre provides such a good opportunity to present a relationship that evolves between people who initially do not seem to have anything in common. But then Thelma and Louise came out, and we did not want it to look like we were copying it. So instead, we decided to move in the direction of screwball comedy, which is a form of comedy...\"",

Using feminist and postcolonial theory this book examines the impact of multiculturalism and globalization on embodiment and community whilst considering the ethical and political implication of its critique for post-colonial feminism.\nA diverse range of texts are analyzed which produce the figure of 'the stranger', showing that it has alternatively been expelled as the origin of danger - such as in neighbourhood watch, or celebrated as the origin of difference - as in multiculturalism. The author argues that both of these standpoints are problematic as they involve 'stranger fetishism'; they assume that the stranger 'has a life of its own'.\"",

Riedner, JAC\nWhat do emotions do? How do emotions move us or get us stuck? In developing a theory of the cultural politics of emotion, Sara Ahmed focuses on the relationship between emotions, language, and bodies. She shows how emotions are named in speech acts, as well as how they involve sensations that can be felt not only emotionally, but physically. A new methodology for reading 'the emotionality of texts' is offered as are analyses of the role of emotions in debates on international terrorism, asylum and migration, and reconciliation and reparation. Attending to the intersections between race, gender, and sexuality, The Cultural Politics of Emotion is in dialogue with key trends in gender studies and cultural studies, the psychology and sociology of emotions, and phenomenology and psychoanalysis. It takes as its point of entry different emotions -- pain, hate, fear, disgust, shame, and love -- and reflects on the role of emotions in feminist and queer politics.\"",

            "description": "\"In this groundbreaking work, Sara Ahmed demonstrates how queer studies can put phenomenology to productive use. Focusing on the \u201corientation\u201d aspect of \u201csexual orientation\u201d and the \u201corient\u201d in \u201corientalism,\u201d Ahmed examines what it means for bodies to be situated in space and time. Bodies take shape as they move through the world directing themselves toward or away from objects and others. Being \u201corientated\u201d means feeling at home, knowing where one stands, or having certain objects within reach. Orientations affect what is proximate to the body or what can be reached. A queer phenomenology, Ahmed contends, reveals how social relations are arranged spatially, how queerness disrupts and reorders these relations by not following the accepted paths, and how a politics of disorientation puts other objects within reach, those that might, at first glance, seem awry.\nAhmed proposes that a queer phenomenology might investigate not only how the concept of orientation is informed by phenomenology but also the orientation of phenomenology itself. Thus she reflects on the significance of the objects that appear\u2014and those that do not\u2014as signs of orientation in classic phenomenological texts such as Husserl\u2019s Ideas. In developing a queer model of orientations, she combines readings of phenomenological texts\u2014by Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Fanon\u2014with insights drawn from queer studies, feminist theory, critical race theory, Marxism, and psychoanalysis. Queer Phenomenology points queer theory in bold new directions.\"",

            "description": "\"The Promise of Happiness is a provocative cultural critique of the imperative to be happy. It asks what follows when we make our desires and even our own happiness conditional on the happiness of others: \u201cI just want you to be happy\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy.\u201d Combining philosophy and feminist cultural studies, Sara Ahmed reveals the affective and moral work performed by the \u201chappiness duty,\u201d the expectation that we will be made happy by taking part in that which is deemed good, and that by being happy ourselves, we will make others happy. Ahmed maintains that happiness is a promise that directs us toward certain life choices and away from others. Happiness is promised to those willing to live their lives in the right way.\nAhmed draws on the intellectual history of happiness, from classical accounts of ethics as the good life, through seventeenth-century writings on affect and the passions, eighteenth-century debates on virtue and education, and nineteenth-century utilitarianism. She engages with feminist, antiracist, and queer critics who have shown how happiness is used to justify social oppression, and how challenging oppression causes unhappiness. Reading novels and films including Mrs. Dalloway, The Well of Loneliness, Bend It Like Beckham, and Children of Men, Ahmed considers the plight of the figures who challenge and are challenged by the attribution of happiness to particular objects or social ideals: the feminist killjoy, the unhappy queer, the angry black woman, and the melancholic migrant. Through her readings she raises critical questions about the moral order imposed by the injunction to be happy.\"",

Sara Ahmed offers an account of the diversity world based on interviews with diversity practitioners in higher education, as well as her own experience of doing diversity work. Diversity is an ordinary, even unremarkable, feature of institutional life. Yet diversity practitioners often experience institutions as resistant to their work, as captured through their use of the metaphor of the \"brick wall.\" On Being Included offers an explanation of this apparent paradox. It explores the gap between symbolic commitments to diversity and the experience of those who embody diversity. Commitments to diversity are understood as \"non-performatives\" that do not bring about what they name. The book provides an account of institutional whiteness and shows how racism can be obscured by the institutionalization of diversity. Diversity is used as evidence that institutions do not have a problem with racism. On Being Included offers a critique of what happens when diversity is offered as a solution. It also shows how diversity workers generate knowledge of institutions in attempting to transform them.\"",

To make complaints within institutions is to learn how they work and for whom they work: complaint as feminist pedagogy. Ahmed explores how complaints are made behind closed doors and how doors are often closed on those who complain. To open these doors---to get complaints through, keep them going, or keep them alive---Ahmed emphasizes, requires forming new kinds of collectives. This book offers a systematic analysis of the methods used to stop complaints and a powerful and poetic meditation on what complaints can be used to do. Following a long lineage of Black feminist and feminist of color critiques of the university, Ahmed delivers a timely consideration of how institutional change becomes possible and why it is necessary.\"",

Yet much recent theorizing of our so-called \u2018postmodern' life emphasizes movement and fluidity without interrogating who and what is \u2018on the move'. This original and timely book examines the interdependence of mobility and belonging by considering how homes are formed in relationship to movement. It suggests that movement does not only happen when one leaves home, and that homes are not always fixed in a single location. Home and belonging may involve attachment and movement, fixation and loss, and the transgression and enforcement of boundaries. What is the relationship between leaving home and the imagining of home itself? And having left home, what might it mean to return? How can we re-think what it means to be grounded, or to stay put? Who moves and who stays? What interaction is there between those who stay and those who arrive and leave? Focusing on differences of race, gender, class and sexuality, the contributors reveal how the movements of bodies and communities are intrinsic to the making of homes, nations, identities and boundaries. They reflect on the different experiences of being at home, leaving home, and going home. They also explore ways in which attachment to place and locality can be secured - as well as challenged - through the movements that make up our dwelling places.\"",

The imperative to speak out and to tell one's story operates across the traditional boundaries of public and private spaces, and is mobilised by disenfranchised subjects and celebrities alike. These testimonial forms are evident both in popular culture, such as talk shows and confessional television more generally, and in mainstream politics, as demonstrated by the confessions of public figures, such as the late Princess Diana or President Clinton.\"",

The key question she raises is: to what extent does the argument that gender is culturally constructred leave 'sex' out as something originary, or, at least, untheorised? The division between sex and gender, after all, implies the irreducibility of either category. Making the disctinction between sex and gender protects the biological (as sex) from the contingencies implicit in cultural inscription. If we were to radicalise the constructionist position and argue that sex is always already gender, always already implicated in a cultural regime, where would that leave us? If we cannot separate out sex from gender in any final or foundational way, then how can we theorise the production of 'sex' itself as an instance of the gendering process?\"",

It offers, not a migrant ontology, but a consideration of the historical determination of patterns of estrangement in which the living and yet mediated relation between being, home and world is partially reconfigured from the perspective of those who have left home. This reconfiguration does not take place through the heroic act of an individual (the migrant), but through the forming of communities that create multiple identifications through collective acts of remembering in the absence of a shared knowledge or a familiar terrain. The article interweaves a variety of different texts: short stories by Asian women in Britain, autobiographical reflection, theoretical constructions of migrancy and literature from two very different nomadic or migrant communities, the Global Nomads International and the Asian Women\u2019s Writing Collective. The article provides a critique of recent theories of migrancy - and nomadism - as inherently transgressive, or as an ontological condition (where what we have in common is the loss of a home). The author argues that it is through an uncommon estrangement that the possibility of migrant communities comes to be lived. That is, it is the uncommon estrangement of migration that allows migrant subjects to remake what it is they might yet have in common.\"",

The narrative of becoming woman functions as a narrative of overcoming, whereby the privilege of the masculine subject is determined as his ability to move beyond him-self. This reading is juxtaposed with a reading of the film, Dances with Wolves. Here, the narrative of becoming Indian is predicated on the heroism of the white masculine subject: through hybridization, he can unmake the border between self and other. By bringing these alien texts into contact, the paper suggests that becomings can easily support the structures of privilege which authorize certain 'beings' over others. The paper hence calls for an ethics of closer reading: getting closer to such masterful texts enables the reader to take the risk of a critical judgement.\"",

Immediately, to frame the question of strange(r)ness\nin terms of recognition rather than misrecognition is to challenge the assumption that the\nstranger is the one who is not the object of knowledge. For in such a question, knowledge\nis staged as constitutive not only of what is familiar, what is already known or indeed\nknowable, but also of what is strange, and who is the stranger. The stranger here is not\nsomebody we do not recognise, but somebody that we recognise as a stranger, somebody we know as not knowing, rather than somebody we simply do not know. The stranger\nis produced as an object of knowledge, rather than coming into being in an absence of\nknowledge. The implications of such a rethinking of the relationship between knowledge and strangers are far reaching: it suggests that knowledge is bound up in the formation\nof a community, that is, with the formation of a \u2018we\u2019 that knows through (rather than\nagainst) the stranger.

            "description": "\"The question \u2018what counts as feminist theory?\u2019 is an instructive one: first, it suggests to me that some theories and not others count as feminist; second, it suggests that the demarcation of feminist theory as an entity is not a simple act, but one that involves a set of criteria about \u2018what is feminism\u2019 as well as \u2018what is theory\u2019 that are always in dispute. That is, the question \u2018what counts as feminist theory?\u2019 suggests that somebody is doing the counting. As I arrive at this question, I have to both laugh and grimace: I can almost see a ghostly image of a woman, upstairs in the dusty attics of our institutions, counting out theories, counting out feminisms. . . . I can almost hear her voice, gleeful and joyous, as she throws out some works, names them as impostors, saying that they don\u2019t count, that they can\u2019t be counted. Am I that woman? Have I been her? Are you her? Have you made such judgements with the ease of the one who is counted, of the one who counts? But enough of my fantasies. In the first instance, this question invites us to refuse an uncritical relativism, that is, a position which might assume that anything can count as feminist theory. At the same time, and in the same gesture, a universalist position which assumes that some things are feminist theory, now and always, might be called into question. In a critical horizon whereby relativist and universalist models of feminist theory are no longer possible, we must begin with a complicated and contingent model of the production of feminist theory. Feminist theory, that is, is not simply about any kind of theoretical work, or only a certain kind of theoretical work: it is produced in particular ways, in different times and places. What gets recognized as feminist theory is hence contingent, that is, it is dependent on specific contexts of articulation (those institutional conditions which include ways of writing and reading, as well as forms of cultural capital). In other words, we need to ask: where is the work that is recognized as feminist theory (for example, that is taught on core \u2018feminist theory\u2019 courses, or that is shelved in bookshops under the thematic of \u2018feminist theory\u2019) being produced? How does this work relate to other kinds of feminist work that are not named as feminist theory? How does it relate to work that is named as theory but not as feminist?\"",

Rather than assuming hate is a psychological disposition - that it comes from within a psyche and then moves out to others - the paper suggests that hate works to align individual and collective bodies through the very intensity of its attachments. Such alignments are unstable precisely given the fact that hate does not reside in a subject, object or body; the instability of hate is what makes it so powerful in generating the effects that it does. Furthermore, although hate does not reside positively in a subject, body or sign, this does not mean that hate does have effects that are structural and mediated. This paper shows that hate becomes attached or \u2018stuck\u2019 to particular bodies, often through violence, force and harm. The paper dramatizes its arguments by a reflection on racism as hate crime, looking at the circulation of figures of hate in discourses of nationhood, from both extreme right wing and mainstream political parties. It also considers the part of what hate is doing can precisely be understood in terms of the affect it has on the bodies of those designated as the hated, an affective life that is crucial to the injustice of hate crime.\"",

Rather than suggesting a feminist ethics should simply be for \u2018the other\u2019, or that feminist ethics is always futural (dedicated to that which is not yet), the paper suggests that ethics involves responding to the particular other in a present that carries traces of the past, as well as opening up the future. It is through responding to particular others (where particularity is not understood as a characteristic of another, but as a mode of encounter) that we face and face up to \u2018other others\u2019. The relationship between \u2018this other\u2019 and \u2018other others\u2019 suggests an intimacy between the particular and the collective, between the face-to-face of an encounter and political economies, and between feminist ethics and politics. Indeed, the paper concludes by suggesting that the ethical and political imperatives of feminism are aligned precisely given that collectivity is an effect of the work that has to be done to get closer to this other and, with her, other others. This other and other others collect together in the making of a feminist \u2018we\u2019. Such a \u2018we\u2019 can be embraced only through a willingness to struggle with and for others who are faced in the present (a facing that is indebted to a past that cannot be left behind), and an openness to the future, as the promise and hope of what we might yet become.\"",

What does it mean to stand for love by standing alongside some others and against other others? It has become common for \u2018hate groups\u2019 to re-name themselves as organisations of love. Such organisations claim they act out of love for their own kind, and for the nation as an inheritance of kind (\u2018our White Racial Family\u2019), rather than out of hatred for strangers or others. Indeed, a crucial part of the re-naming is the identification of hate as coming from elsewhere and as being directed towards the \u2018hate group\u2019; hate becomes an emotion that belongs to those who have identified hate groups as hate groups in this first place. In the above quote, the hate watch web site, which lists racist groups on the internet, is juxtaposed with the Lovewatch site, which also lists these organisations, but names them as \u2018love groups\u2019. Such groups are defined as \u2018love groups\u2019 through an active identification with the nation (\u2018those who love this nation\u2019) as well as a core set of values (\u2018anyone who loves liberty\u2019). Love is narrated as the emotion that energies the work of such groups; it is out of love that the group seeks to defend the nation against others, whose presence then becomes defined as the origin of hate. As another site puts it: \u2018Ask yourself, what have they done to eliminate anything at all? They feed you with, \"Don\u2019t worry, we are watching the hate groups\" and things like this. You know what they do? They create the very hate they purport to try to erase!\u2019 (About Hate) It is the very critique of racism as a form of hate, which becomes seen as the conditions of production for hate; the \u2018true\u2019 hated group is the white groups who are, out of love, seeking to defend the nation against others, who threaten to \u2018steal\u2019 the nation away.\"",

Such judgments are not simply about reading the testimonios of others as \"perjured\", but also work to construct others as fearsome and threatening, such that the defence of truth becomes \"a matter of life and death.\" To explore the role of fear in containing others, the author offers a reading of the Mench\u00fa controversy alongside the reception given to Sunera Thobani's speech in which she criticizes the United States' \"war on terrorism.\" She shows how Thobani's speech is constructed as an act of terror because it calls into question the very \"truths\" that have justified the war, by showing that they rely on an ontological distinction between legitimate and illegitimate violence. The paper relates both the Mench\u00fa and Thobani cases to broader discourses of fear and anxiety that have circulated since September 11 2001 and argues that fear works to secure \"truths\" precisely through the narration of crisis or insecurity. Rather than considering fear as coming from within a subject, or as a characteristic of an object, the author suggests that fear works to effect the very boundaries between subjects and others, partly through the feeling that such boundaries have already been threatened by the presence of others.\"",

In this essay, I argue that emotions play a crucial role in the \"surfacing\" of individual and collective bodies through the way in which emotions circulate between bodies and signs. Such an argument clearly challenges any assumption that emotions are a private matter, that they simply belong to individuals, or even that they come from within and then move outward toward others. It suggests that emotions are not simply \"within\" or \"without\" but that they create the very effect of the surfaces or boundaries of bodies and worlds. For instance, in the above narrative on the Aryan Nations Web site, the role of emotions, in particular of hate and love, is crucial to the delineation of the bodies of individual subjects and the body of the nation. Here a subject (the white nationalist, the average white man, the white housewife, the white working man, the white citizen, and the white Christian farmer) is presented as endangered by imagined others whose proximity threatens not only to take something away from the subject (jobs, security, wealth), but to take the place of the subject. In other words, the presence of these others is imagined as a threat to the object of love. The narrative involves a rewriting of history, in which the labor of others (migrants, slaves) is concealed in a fantasy that it is the white subject who \"built this land.\" The white subjects claim the place of hosts (\"our shores\") at the same time as they claim the position of the victim, as the ones who are damaged by an \"unmerciful government.\"\"",

            "description": "\"This article examines \u2018collective feelings\u2019 by considering how \u2018others\u2019 create impressions on the surfaces of bodies. Rather than considering \u2018collective feeling\u2019 as \u2018fellow feeling\u2019 or in terms of feeling \u2018for\u2019 the collective, the article suggests that how we respond to others in intercorporeal encounters creates the impression of a collective body. In other words, how we feel about others is what aligns us with a collective, which paradoxically \u2018takes shape\u2019 only as an effect of such alignments. The article considers different examples of racism in which a particular other is held in place by being aligned with other others. The \u2018moment of contact\u2019 is shaped by past histories of contact, which allows the proximity of a racial other to be perceived as threatening, at the same time as it re-shapes the bodies in the contact zone of the encounter. Feelings rehearse associations that are already in place, in the way in which they \u2018read\u2019 the proximity of others, at the same time as they establish the \u2018truth\u2019 of the reading. The article extends its analysis by showing that bodily proximity is not required to create the impressions of others, and offers an analysis of \u2018collective feelings\u2019 within virtual communities of global nomads. Proximity does not require physical co-presence: the collective can \u2018surface\u2019 through giving up on local attachments (where the screen becomes a substitute for the skin). The article concludes that collective feelings are not feelings that the collective \u2018has\u2019, as if the collective was a subject. Rather the collective is an effect of the impressions left by others on the surfaces of skins.\"",

The paper offers a general critique of the mode of declaration, in which 'admissions' of 'bad practice' are taken up as signs of 'good practice', as well as a more specific critique of how whiteness studies constitutes itself through such declarations. The declarative mode involves a fantasy of transcendence in which 'what' is transcended is the very 'thing' admitted to in the declaration (for example, if we are say that we are racists, then we are not racists, as racists do not know they are racists). By investigating declarative speech acts, the paper offers a critique of the self-reflexive turn in whiteness studies, suggesting that we should not rush too quickly beyond the exposure of racism by turning towards whiteness as a marked category, by identifying 'what white people can do' , by describing good practice, or even by assuming that whiteness studies can provide the conditions of anti-racism. Declarations of whiteness could be described as ''unhappy performatives', the conditions are not in place that would allow such declarations to do what they say.\"",

If we know where we are, when we turn this way or that, then we are oriented. We have our bearings. We know what to do to get to this place or to that. To be oriented is also to be oriented toward certain objects, those that help us find our way. These are the objects we recognize, such that when we face them, we know which way we are facing. They gather on the ground and also create a ground on which we can gather. Yet objects gather quite differently, creating different grounds. What difference does it make what we are oriented toward? My interest in this broad question of orientation is motivated by an interest in the specific question of sexual orientation. What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of \"orientation,\" then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question? This article takes up the concept of orientation to put queer studies into a closer dialogue with phenomenology. \"",

And what secures the separation of its inadmissible matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions? When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I don't mean this body'.

Different traditions within philosophy have offered very different arguments about happiness, from classical Greek models of eudaimonia as a good and virtuous life, to utilitarian models of happiness as the greatest good. The papers in this special issue offer fresh perspectives on this intellectual history of happiness. Rather than begin with the question 'what is happiness?' a cultural studies approach asks: 'what does happiness do?' To what do we appeal to when we appeal to happiness? It is certainly the case that happiness is appealing. Happiness is consistently described as the object of human desire, as being what we aim for, as what gives meaning and order to human life. As Bruno S. Frye and Alois Stutzer argue in their economics of happiness, 'Everybody wants to be happy. There is probably no other goal in life that commands such a high degree of consensus'. Happiness might acquire its hold by being given as an essential truth, as 'something' that we have already consented to in the very direction of our wants. \"",

With reference to a research project based on interviews with diversity practitioners, as well as personal experience of working within universities as a Black feminist, this paper explores how diversity becomes a commitment that requires that those who embody that diversity express happiness and gratitude. Our very arrival into organisations is used as evidence that the whiteness of which we speak no longer exists. Most importantly to embody diversity can mean to be under pressure not to speak about racism. The very talk about racism is seen as introducing bad feeling into organisations. Drawing on the work of bell hooks and Audre Lorde, the paper argues that we need to reclaim the figure of the angry Black feminist, and that we need to refuse the injunction to be happy objects for the organisation, which means being willing to cause trouble and being prepared to stay as sore as our points.\"",

            "description": "\"This article offers a feminist critique of happiness. It proceeds by suspending belief that happiness is a good thing, or that happiness is what we want, as beliefs that are central to the intellectual history of happiness. The article suggests that feminist histories might offer an alternative history of happiness. It shows how happiness is what makes some things into goods (happy objects are those that are anticipated to cause happiness) and introduces the concept of conditional happiness, when one person\u2019s happiness is made conditional upon another\u2019s, to explore how, for some, happiness means following other people\u2019s goods. The article considers feminist consciousness as a consciousness of unhappiness, of what is lost or is given up by following the paths of happiness. Such consciousness does not necessarily involve a form of self\u2010consciousness but a worldly consciousness in which unhappiness disturbs the familiar. The article reflects specifically on black feminist consciousness as a consciousness of what does not get noticed when happiness provides a horizon of experience. It concludes by suggesting that feminists might want to claim the freedom to be unhappy without making unhappiness into a political cause.\"",

By framing feminist thought as a critique of happiness, it suggests that the feminist subject should be understood as a \u201cwillful subject\u201d. The feminist willfulness is thus understood as the uncertain ground for a collective politics translating individual emotions, the pain or anger felt in the face of injustices. Furthermore, the figure of the willful feminist subject may help understand the ways by which, within feminist spaces, black women have been reduced to their anger and designated as the cause of divisions produced by racism. The position of willfulness is therefore as much a place of political tensions as a place for political claims.\"",

Reflecting on how an education in virtue became an education of the will, the paper explores how some characters become \u201cwillful parts\u201d when they do not align their wills with the moral and general will. Drawing on readings of willfulness in novels by George Eliot, including Daniel Deronda, Mill on the Floss and Romola, the paper explores how feminist histories might involve the willful claiming of the attribite of willfulness. The paper suggests that when willfulness is reclaimed, it exceeds the very system of characterization, even when it appears to fulfill a set of expectations of what is behind an action.\"",

Perhaps trouble need not carry such a negative valence. To make trouble was, within the reigning discourse of my childhood, something one should never do, precisely because that would get one in trouble. The rebellion and its reprimand seemed to be caught up in the same terms, a phenomenon that gave rise into my first critical insight into the subtle ruse of power: the prevailing law threatened one with trouble, even put one in trouble, all to keep one out of trouble.

Whilst this collection stages an intimate dialogue with the growing feminist literature on lived and imagined embodiment, it avoids taking \u2018the body\u2019 as its privileged \ufb01gure. Instead, it focuses on \u2018the skin\u2019, as the outer covering of the body that both \u2018protects us from others and exposes us to them\u2019 (Cataldi 1993: 145). In making this shift, we call for a skin-tight politics, a politics that takes as its orientation not the body as such, but the \ufb02eshy interface between bodies and worlds. \u2018Thinking through the skin\u2019 is a thinking that re\ufb02ects, not on the body as the lost object of thought, but on inter-embodiment, on the mode of being-with and being-for, where one touches and is touched by others.\"",

            "description": "\"What does it mean to describe bodies as \u2018racialized\u2019? The term \u2018racialized bodies\u2019 invites us to think of the multiple processes whereby bodies come to be seen as \u2018having\u2019 a racial identity. One\u2019s \u2018racial identity\u2019 is not simply determined, for example, by the \u2018fact\u2019 of one\u2019s skin colour. Racialization is a process that takes place in time and space: \u2018race\u2019 is an effect of this process, rather than its origin or cause. So, in the case of skin colour, racialization involves a process of investing skin colour with meaning, such that \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 come to function, not as descriptions of skin colour, but as racial identities. The term \u2018racialized bodies\u2019 has another implication, of course. It suggests that that we cannot understand the production of race without reference to embodiment: if racialization involves multiple processes, then these processes involve the marking out of bodies as the site of racialization itself.\"",

References to affect, emotions and intensities abound, their implications in terms of research practices have often remained less manifest. Working with Affect in Feminist Readings: Disturbing Differences explores the place and function of affect in feminist knowledge production in general and in textual methodology in particular. With an international group of contributors from studies of history, media, philosophy, culture, ethnology, art, literature and religion, the volume investigates affect as the dynamics of reading, as carnal encounters and as possibilities for the production of knowledge. Working with Affect in Feminist Readings asks what exactly are we doing when working with affect, and what kinds of ethical, epistemological and ontological issues this involves. Not limiting itself to descriptive accounts, the volume takes part in establishing new ways of understanding feminist methodology.\"",

            "description": "\"New Materialisms brings into focus and explains the significance of the innovative materialist critiques that are emerging across the social sciences and humanities. By gathering essays that exemplify the new thinking about matter and processes of materialization, this important collection shows how scholars are reworking older materialist traditions, contemporary theoretical debates, and advances in scientific knowledge to address pressing ethical and political challenges. In the introduction, Diana Coole and Samantha Frost highlight common themes among the distinctive critical projects that comprise the new materialisms. The continuities they discern include a posthumanist conception of matter as lively or exhibiting agency, and a reengagement with both the material realities of everyday life and broader geopolitical and socioeconomic structures.\nCoole and Frost argue that contemporary economic, environmental, geopolitical, and technological developments demand new accounts of nature, agency, and social and political relationships; modes of inquiry that privilege consciousness and subjectivity are not adequate to the task. New materialist philosophies are needed to do justice to the complexities of twenty-first-century biopolitics and political economy, because they raise fundamental questions about the place of embodied humans in a material world and the ways that we produce, reproduce, and consume our material environment.\"",

            "description": "\"This field-defining collection consolidates and builds momentum in the burgeoning area of affect studies. The contributors include many of the central theorists of affect\u2014those visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally other than conscious knowing that can serve to drive us toward movement, thought, and ever-changing forms of relation. As Lauren Berlant explores \u201ccruel optimism,\u201d Brian Massumi theorizes the affective logic of public threat, and Elspeth Probyn examines shame, they, along with the other contributors, show how an awareness of affect is opening up exciting new insights in disciplines from anthropology, cultural studies, geography, and psychology to philosophy, queer studies, and sociology. In essays diverse in subject matter, style, and perspective, the contributors demonstrate how affect theory illuminates the intertwined realms of the aesthetic, the ethical, and the political as they play out across bodies (human and non-human) in both mundane and extraordinary ways. They reveal the broad theoretical possibilities opened by an awareness of affect as they reflect on topics including ethics, food, public morale, glamor, snark in the workplace, and mental health regimes. The Affect Theory Reader includes an interview with the cultural theorist Lawrence Grossberg and an afterword by the anthropologist Kathleen Stewart. In the introduction, the editors suggest ways of defining affect, trace the concept\u2019s history, and highlight the role of affect theory in various areas of study.\"",

            "description": "\"Queer theory essays on time and becoming in the fields of literature, philosophy, film, and performance. If queer theorists have agreed on anything, it is that for queer thought to have any specificity at all, it must be characterized by becoming, the constant breaking of habits. Queer Times, Queer Becomings explores queer articulations of time and becoming in literature, philosophy, film, and performance. Whether in the contexts of psychoanalysis, the nineteenth-century discourses of evolution and racial sciences, or the daily rhythms of contemporary, familially oriented communities, queerness has always been marked by a peculiar untimeliness, by a lack of proper orientation in terms of time as much as social norms. Yet it is the skewed relation to the temporal norm that also gives queerness its singular hope. This is demonstrated by the essays collected here as they consider the ways in which queer theory has acknowledged, resisted, appropriated, or refused divergent models of temporality. \u201cThis book opens up new areas and new questions for queer theory by bringing together the writings of some of the most well-known and respected writers with the work of a number of exciting younger scholars regarding queer temporalities, queer experiences of time, and queer times themselves. Time deserves queering; and equally queer sexualities and styles are queer partly in virtue of their untimeliness.\"",

Johny Pitts visits the former Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, where West African students are still making the most of Cold War ties with the USSR, and Clichy Sous Bois in Paris, which gave birth to the 2005 riots, all the while presenting Afropeans as lead actors in their own story.\"",

Drawing from his experience of growing up in the multicultural hinterlands (and disappearing landscape) of the north of Britain, Pitts explains how the preservation of Black European culture through visual documentation is essential but demands an alternative philosophy and methodology if it is to work as a counter-current in the stream of Western observers hunting \u201cthe other\u201d. He draws attention to photographic philosophies that operate outside the white male-dominated tradition at Magnum, the world\u2019s most famous and influential photographic agency. Ultimately, using his own position within the Afropean community, Pitts concludes that taking images of one\u2019s own community requires a heuristic approach, with one foot in and one foot out of both the photographic tradition and the community being documented.\"",

Gramsci\u2019s reputation, still local and marginal outside his native Italy in the early sixties, has a decade later become a world-wide fame. The homage due to his enterprise in prison is now\u2014 thirty years after the first publication of his notebooks\u2014finally and fully being paid. Lack of knowledge, or paucity of discussion, have ceased to be obstacles to the diffusion of his thought. In principle every revolutionary socialist, not only in the West\u2014if especially in the West\u2014can henceforward benefit from Gramsci\u2019s patrimony. Yet at the same time, the spread of Gramsci\u2019s renown has not to date been accompanied by any corresponding depth of enquiry into his work. The very range of the appeals now made to his authority, from the most contrasted sectors of the Left, suggests the limits of close study or comprehension of his ideas. The price of so ecumenical an admiration is necessarily ambiguity: multiple and incompatible interpretations of the themes of the Prison Notebooks.\"",

In the case studies of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements, Crehan theorizes the complex relationships between the experience of inequality, exploitation, and oppression, as well as the construction of political narratives. Gramsci's Common Sense is an accessible and concise introduction to a key Marxist thinker whose works illuminate the increasing inequality in the twenty-first century.\"",

The posthumous publication of his Prison Notebooks established him as a major thinker whose influence continues to increase.\nFiori\u2019s biography enlarges upon the facts of Gramsci\u2019s life through personal accounts, and through Gramsci\u2019s own writings to relatives and friends. In relating Gramsci\u2019s growth as a political leader and theorist to his private experience, it offers acute insights into his involvement in the factory councils movement. It examines his relationship with political opponents, including Mussolini, and with his comrades within the Communist Party before and during Gramsci\u2019s imprisonment. It is an approach which seeks to explicate, as well as underscore, the substantial achievement of one of the most important figures in western Marxism.\n\"",

As head of the Italian Communist Party in the 1920s, Gramsci was arrested and condemned to 20 years' imprisonment by Mussolini's fascist regime. It was during this imprisonment that Gramsci wrote his famous Prison Notebooks \u2013 over 2,000 pages of profound and influential reflections on history, culture, politics, philosophy and revolution.\nAn Introduction to Antonio Gramsci retraces the trajectory of Gramsci's life, before examining his conceptions of culture, politics and philosophy. Gramsci's writings are then interpreted through the lens of his most famous concept, that of 'hegemony'; Gramsci's thought is then extended and applied to 'think through' contemporary problems to illustrate his distinctive historical methodology. The book concludes with a valuable examination of Gramsci's legacy today and useful tips for further reading.\nGeorge Hoare and Nathan Sperber make Gramsci accessible for students of history, politics and philosophy keen to understand this seminal figure in 20th-century intellectual history.\"",

Peter Ives explores Gramsci\u2019s concern with language from his university studies in linguistics to his last prison notebook. Hegemony has been seen as Gramsci\u2019s most important contribution, but without knowledge of its linguistic roots, it is often misunderstood.\nThis book places Gramsci\u2019s ideas within the linguistically influenced social theory of the twentieth century. It summarizes some of the major ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure, Ludwig Wittgenstein, language philosophy and post-structuralism in relation to Gramsci\u2019s position. By paying great attention to the linguistic underpinnings of Gramsci's Marxism, Language and Hegemony in Gramsci shows how his theorization of power, language and politics address issues raised by post-modernism and the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Chantal Mouffe, and Ernesto Laclau.\"",

The book places these developments within the general context of little known links connecting Italian anarchists and syndicalists to sympathizers in Britain, France, Germany and Russia. The analysis of 'libertarian' politics in Italy is accompanied by a detailed and fascinating reconstruction of the social base of Italian anarchism that challenges the assumptions of much of the political sociology of the European Left. Developing a hitherto unexplored but important aspect of Gramsci's political ideas and strategies, this book contributes to our understanding of one of the central Marxist thinkers and activists of the twentieth century and to one of the critical moments in the history of the European Left. In bringing new life and understanding to an important chapter in contemporary Italian history, this book is likely to become a standard text on this pivotal thinker.\"",

            "description": "\"Taking stock of contemporary social, cultural, and political currents, Timothy Brennan explores key turning points in the recent history of American intellectual life. He contends that a certain social-democratic vision of politics has been banished from public discussion, leading to an unlikely convergence of the political right and the academic left and a deadening of critical opposition. Brennan challenges the conventional view that affiliations based on political belief, claims upon the state, or the public interest have been rendered obsolete by the march of events in the years before and after Reagan. Instead, he lays out a new path for a future infused with a sense of intellectual and political possibility.\nIn highlighting the shift in America's intellectual culture, Brennan makes the case for seeing belief as an identity. As much as race or ethnicity, political belief, Brennan argues, is itself an identity-one that remains unrecognized and without legal protections while possessing its own distinctive culture. Brennan also champions the idea of cosmopolitanism and critiques those theorists who relegate the left to the status of postcolonial \"other.\"\nWars of Position documents how alternative views were chased from the public stage by strategic acts of censorship, including within supposedly dissident wings of the humanities. He explores how the humanities entered the cultural and political mainstream and settled into an awkward secular religion of the \"middle way.\" In a series of interrelated chapters, Brennan considers narratives of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Clinton impeachment; reexamines Salman Rushdie's pre-fatwa writing to illuminate its radical social leanings; presents a startling new interpretation of Edward Said; looks at the fatal reception of Antonio Gramsci within postcolonial history and criticism; and offers a stinging critique of Hardt and Negri's Empire and the influence of Italian radicalism on contemporary cultural theory. Throughout the work, Brennan also draws on and critiques the ideas and influence of Heidegger, Lyotard, Kristeva, and other influential theorists.\"",

            "description": "\"What is colonialism and what is a colonial state? Ranajit Guha points out that the colonial state in South Asia was fundamentally different from the metropolitan bourgeois state which sired it. The metropolitan state was hegemonic in character, and its claim to dominance was based on a power relation in which persuasion outweighed coercion. Conversely, the colonial state was non-hegemonic, and in its structure of dominance coercion was paramount. Indeed, the originality of the South Asian colonial state lay precisely in this difference: a historical paradox, it was an autocracy set up and sustained in the East by the foremost democracy of the Western world. It was not possible for that non-hegemonic state to assimilate the civil society of the colonized to itself. Thus the colonial state, as Guha defines it in this closely argued work, was a paradox\u2014a dominance without hegemony.\nDominance without hegemony had a nationalist aspect as well. This arose from a structural split between the elite and subaltern domains of politics, and the consequent failure of the Indian bourgeoisie to integrate vast areas of the life and consciousness of the people into an alternative hegemony. That predicament is discussed in terms of the nationalist project of anticipating power by mobilizing the masses and producing an alternative historiography. In both endeavors the elite claimed to speak for the people constituted as a nation and sought to challenge the pretensions of an alien regime to represent the colonized. A rivalry between an aspirant to power and its incumbent, this was in essence a contest for hegemony.\"",

            "description": "\"In a letter from prison in 1927 Antonio Gramsci wrote that his mind was in a state of frozen calm, like Nansen\u2019s ship drifting imprisoned for months in the polar ice. With a thirst for information extending to the other continents, and hence to Europe\u2019s relations with them, it would scarcely have been possible for Gramsci not to be drawn to the subject of imperialism. In his brief years of active politics Gramsci never missed an occasion to draw parallels between the exploited peasantry at home and the colonial peoples abroad; and he identified colonialism, for instance in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies in 1925, with export of capital. In examining the Risorgimento, Gramsci was acutely conscious of the gulf between northern and southern Italy, a dichotomy akin, as he said, to that of town and countryside. Gramsci\u2019s underlying aim was to reach an understanding of what Japanese intellectuals stood for.\"",

            "description": "\"Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's original essay \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" transformed the analysis of colonialism through an eloquent and uncompromising argument that affirmed the contemporary relevance of Marxism while using deconstructionist methods to explore the international division of labor and capitalism's \"worlding\" of the world. Spivak's essay hones in on the historical and ideological factors that obstruct the possibility of being heard for those who inhabit the periphery. It is a probing interrogation of what it means to have political subjectivity, to be able to access the state, and to suffer the burden of difference in a capitalist system that promises equality yet withholds it at every turn.\nSince its publication, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" has been cited, invoked, imitated, and critiqued. In these phenomenal essays, eight scholars take stock of the effects and response to Spivak's work. They begin by contextualizing the piece within the development of subaltern and postcolonial studies and the quest for human rights. Then, through the lens of Spivak's essay, they rethink historical problems of subalternity, voicing, and death. A final section situates \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" within contemporary issues, particularly new international divisions of labor and the politics of silence among indigenous women of Guatemala and Mexico. In an afterword, Spivak herself considers her essay's past interpretations and future incarnations and the questions and histories that remain secreted in the original and revised versions of \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\"\u0097both of which are reprinted in this book.\"",

            "description": "\"The \u2018Southern Question' has been a major topic in Italian political, economic and cultural life for a century and more. During the Cold War, it was the justification for heavy government intervention. In contemporary Italy, a major part of the appeal of the Lombard League has been its promise to dissociate the South from the North, even to the point of secession. The South also remains a resonant theme in Italian literature. This interdisciplinary book endeavours to answer the following: - When did people begin to think of the South as a problem? - Who - intellectuals, statisticians, criminologists, political exiles, novelists (among them some important southerners) - contributed to the discourse about the South and why? - Did their view of the South correspond to any sort of reality? - What was glossed over or ignored in the generalized vision of the South as problematic? - What consequences has the \u2018Question' had in controlling the imaginations and actions of intellectuals and those with political and other forms of power? - What alternative formulations might people create and live by if they were able to escape from the control of the \u2018Question' and to imagine the political, economic and cultural differences within Italy in some other way? This timely book reveals how Southern Italians have been affected by distorted versions of a complex reality similar to the discourse of \u2018Orientalism'. In situating the devaluation of Southern Italian culture in relation to the recent emergence of \u2018anti-mafia' ideology in the South and the threat posed to national unity by the Lombard League, it also illuminates the world's stiff inter-regional competition for investment capital.\"",

Specifically, this book endeavors to reassess the impact on postcolonial studies of the central role assigned by Gramsci to culture and literature in the formation of a truly revolutionary idea of the national\u2014a notion that has profoundly shaped the thinking of both Frantz Fanon and Edward Said. Gramsci, as Iain Chambers has argued, has been instrumental in helping scholars rethink their understanding of historical, political, and cultural struggle by substituting the relationship between tradition and modernity with that of subaltern versus hegemonic parts of the world. Combining theoretical reflections and re-interpretations of Gramsci, the scholars in this collection present comparative geo-cultural perspectives on the meaning of the subaltern, passive revolution, hegemony, and the concept of national-popular culture in order to chart out a political map of the postcolonial through the central focus on Gramsci.\"",

Fanon's work will not be possessed by political moment or movement, nor can it be easily placed in a seamless narrative of liberationist history. Fanon's demand for a psychoanalytic explanation emerges from the perverse reflections of 'civil virtue' in the alienating acts of colonial governance: the visibility of cultural 'mummification' in the colonizer's avowed ambition to civilize or modernize the native which results in 'archaic inert institutions under the oppressor's supervision like a caricature of formerly fertile institutions'.

Just as many Iraqi exiles were used to justify the invasion of Iraq, Dabashi demonstrates that this is a common phenomenon, and examines why and how so many immigrant intellectuals help to sustain imperialism.\nThe book radically alters Edward Said\u2019s notion of the \u201cintellectual exile,\u201d in order to show the negative impact of intellectual migration. Dabashi examines the ideology of cultural superiority, and provides a passionate account of how these immigrant intellectuals \u2014 rootless compradors, and guns for hire \u2014 continue to betray any notion of home or country in order to manufacture consent for imperial projects.\"",

Mbembe teases out the intellectual consequences of the reality that Europe is no longer the world's center of gravity while mapping the relations among colonialism, slavery, and contemporary financial and extractive capital. Tracing the conjunction of Blackness with the biological fiction of race, he theorizes Black reason as the collection of discourses and practices that equated Blackness with the nonhuman in order to uphold forms of oppression. Mbembe powerfully argues that this equation of Blackness with the nonhuman will serve as the template for all new forms of exclusion. With Critique of Black Reason, Mbembe offers nothing less than a map of the world as it has been constituted through colonialism and racial thinking while providing the first glimpses of a more just future.\"",

Fanon's Italian reception is interesting for postcolonial scholars in that it differs from the Anglo-American tradition of Fanonian scholarship, and reveals a \u2018pre-postcolonial\u2019 Fanon, prior to his revival through the \u2018symptomatic readings\u2019 of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and other theorists in the 1980s. I also discuss the editorial history of Fanon's publication in Italian; Italy was the first country after France in which Fanon's work appeared, and Giovanni Pirelli's 1971 edition of Fanon's writings, Opere scelte, is possibly the only anthology that presents a selection of essays culled from Fanon's different texts. The Italian Fanon, then, not only offers us an interpretation of the thinker that is specific to Italy, but also serves to historicize his impact in relation to the intellectual and political developments of his time.\"",

He outlines how democracy has begun to embrace its dark side---what he calls its \u201cnocturnal body\u201d---which is based on the desires, fears, affects, relations, and violence that drove colonialism. This shift has hollowed out democracy, thereby eroding the very values, rights, and freedoms liberal democracy routinely celebrates. As a result, war has become the sacrament of our times in a conception of sovereignty that operates by annihilating all those considered enemies of the state. Despite his dire diagnosis, Mbembe draws on post-Foucauldian debates on biopolitics, war, and race as well as Fanon's notion of care as a shared vulnerability to explore how new conceptions of the human that transcend humanism might come to pass. These new conceptions would allow us to encounter the Other not as a thing to exclude but as a person with whom to build a more just world.\"",

Gibson explores him as a truly complex character in the context of his time and beyond. He argues that for Fanon, theory has a practical task to help change the world. Thus Fanon\u2019s \u201cuntidy dialectic,\u201d Gibson contends, is a philosophy of liberation that includes cultural and historical issues and visions of a future society. In a profoundly political sense, Gibson asks us to reevaluate Fanon\u2019s contribution as a critic of modernity and reassess in a new light notions of consciousness, humanism, and social change.\nThis is a fascinating study that will interest undergraduates and above in postcolonial studies, literary theory, cultural studies, sociology, politics, and social and political theory, as well as general readers.\"",

His impact was immediate upon arrival in Algeria, where in 1953 he was appointed to a position in psychiatry at Bilda-Joinville Hospital.

            "title": "\"Bauman: A Biography\" by Izabela Wagner (Publisher: Polity Press)", 
            "description": "\"Global thinker, public intellectual and world-famous theorist of \u2018liquid modernity\u2019, Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017) was a scholar who, despite forced migration, built a very successful academic career and, after retirement, became a prolific and popular writer and an intellectual talisman for young people everywhere. He was one of those rare scholars who, grey-haired and in his eighties, had his finger on the pulse of the youth. \nThis is the first comprehensive biography of Bauman\u2019s life and work.  Izabela Wagner returns to Bauman\u2019s native Poland and recounts his childhood in an assimilated Polish Jewish family and the school experiences shaped by anti-Semitism. Bauman\u2019s life trajectory is typical of his generation and social group: the escape from Nazi occupation and Soviet secondary education, communist engagement, enrolment in the Polish Army as a political officer, participation in the WW II and the support for the new political regime in the post-war Poland. Wagner sheds new light on the post-war period and Bauman\u2019s activity as a KBW political officer. His eviction in 1953 from the military ranks and his academic career reflect the dynamic context of Poland in 1950s and 1960s. His professional career in Poland was abruptly halted in 1968 by the anti-Semitic purges. Bauman became a refugee again - leaving Poland for Israel, and then settling down in Leeds in the UK in 1971. His work would flourish in Leeds, and after his retirement in 1991 he entered a period of enormous productivity which propelled him onto the international stage as one of the most widely read and influential social thinkers of our time.  \nWagner\u2019s biography brings out the complex connections between Bauman\u2019s life experiences and his work, showing how his trajectory as an \u2018outsider\u2019 forced into exile by the anti-Semitic purges in Poland has shaped his thinking over time.  Her careful and thorough account will be the standard biography of Bauman\u2019s life and work for years to come.\"",

            "description": "\"\u2018For a Postcolonial Bauman? (Mis)Conception and Critique\u2019\nAny attempt to frame Bauman in relation to postcolonial social thought requires a deeper understanding of postcolonial thought itself. By way of introducing some of the themes of the lecture series on a \u201cPostcolonial Baumann\u201d this talk first maps the main contours of postcolonial thought. It addresses common misconceptions of postcolonial theory and highlights postcolonial theory\u2019s roots in anticolonial thought, its implicit perspectival realism, and its critique of modernity that centers the persistent effects and legacies of empire. In this light, postcolonial theory can then be situated alongside Bauman\u2019s critique of modernity while also illuminating the latter\u2019s potential and possible limitations for meeting the postcolonial critique.\n\u2018Ambivalence and (Post)Coloniality: Mapping Critiques of Modernity from its Margins\u2019\nThe production of social difference, from the figures of the stranger and the non-citizen up to the racialised Other \u2013 and the processes of exclusion resulting from it \u2013have been prominent targets of various critiques of modernity as a project. While for Zygmunt Bauman, the production of difference in modernity engenders ambivalence, in decolonial thought the generation of alterity is the basis for the underside of modernity, coloniality. This lecture addresses how the (dis)similarities between these critiques speak to different experiences of exclusion across the colonial/imperial divide and what implications \u2018decolonising\u2019 Bauman might have for a radical critique of modernity.\n\u2018Imperial Entanglements: Rethinking Modernity with and beyond Zygmunt Bauman\u2019\nEngaging critically with Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s contribution to our understanding of modernity, which played an important role in shifting the debate beyond the teleology of unilinear modernisation, this lecture addresses the Eurocentrism that characterises not only classical but also contemporary sociological theorisations of modernity, including that of Bauman. It will examine some recent alternative theorisations in terms of plural, regional or vernacular modernities. In a postcolonial perspective, it will be argued that only a consideration of imperial spatial and temporal entanglements allows us to grasp modernity as relational in the past and in the present. It illustrates these using ethnographic material from my own field research in India on legal entanglements.\n\u2018Bauman\u2019s Analysis of European Modernity, its Local and Remote Others, and the Colonial Imprint of the Christian Imaginary\u2019\nWith the currency of intersectionality in feminist theory, the widespread demand for decolonisation of knowledge and the urgencies of the Black Lives Matter movement, I propose to examine if and how Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s reflections on Christian Europe\u2019s modernity and its local Others have a place in our considerations of postcolonial critique. European colonialism evangelised for a Christianity enacting domination and economic exploitation in its name. This lecture locates Bauman\u2019s indirect relation to Modern Jewish Studies as a site for discovering a postcolonial Bauman, drawing on several specific examples from art/film created in response to traumatic events of the twentieth century.\"",

He lived among Kingston's stiflingly respectable brown middle class, who, in their habits and ambitions, measured themselves against the white elite. As colonial rule was challenged, things began to change in Kingston and across the world. In 1951 a Rhodes scholarship took Hall across the Atlantic to Oxford University, where he met young Jamaicans from all walks of life, as well as writers and thinkers from across the Caribbean, including V. S. Naipaul and George Lamming. While at Oxford he met Raymond Williams, Charles Taylor, and other leading intellectuals, with whom he helped found the intellectual and political movement known as the New Left. With the emotional aftershock of colonialism still pulsing through him, Hall faced a new struggle: that of building a home, a life, and an identity in a postwar England so rife with racism that it could barely recognize his humanity.\nWith great insight, compassion, and wit, Hall tells the story of his early life, taking readers on a journey through the sights, smells, and streets of 1930s Kingston while reflecting on the thorny politics of 1950s and 1960s Britain. Full of passion and wisdom, Familiar Stranger is the intellectual memoir of one of our greatest minds.\"",

The eight foundational lectures Hall delivered at the University of Illinois in 1983 introduced North American audiences to a thinker and discipline that would shift the course of critical scholarship. Unavailable until now, these lectures present Hall's original engagements with the theoretical positions that contributed to the formation of Cultural Studies. Throughout this personally guided tour of Cultural Studies' intellectual genealogy, Hall discusses the work of Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, and E. P. Thompson; the influence of structuralism; the limitations and possibilities of Marxist theory; and the importance of Althusser and Gramsci. Throughout these theoretical reflections, Hall insists that Cultural Studies aims to provide the means for political change.\"",

He said, with his usual bluntness: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible novel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I could not disagree\u2014in general I had trouble disagreeing with him even when I wanted to. But I said I thought that whatever its aesthetic value, the novel was nevertheless interesting for the scandal it had caused. Taking the Palestinian side, to some European readers, seemed identical with teaching hatred and violence to children. And it was interesting for the \u201cauthenticity\u201d issue raised by Ghazy not being Palestinian, not having lived in Palestine/Israel, and having found out what was going on in the Intifada largely from television. To invoke the vocabulary of high school, which there is extra reason to invoke here, this is the irritatingly persistent issue of the wannabe: wanting to be a Palestinian, wanting to join someone else\u2019s revolution, and the sorts of gut-level resistance that any such desire seems to confront even from those who do not consider themselves champions of authenticity. Thinking back to the LeCarr\u00e9 novel about another Palestinian sympathizer, one might call this the \u201cLittle Drummer Girl syndrome\u201d: the universal contempt on all sides for the one who is free to choose sides, but is not rooted in either, and thereby threatens to display the radical contingency of even the most rooted identity and commitment.\"",

            "description": "\"\"I'm the last Jewish intellectual.... The only true follower of Adorno. Let me put it this way: I'm a Jewish-Palestinian,\" says Said provocatively in a 2000 interview in the leading Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz. A pathbreaking intellectual and renowned political activist, Said never consents to being pigeonholed. These interviews trace his thoughtful perspectives and his unflinching candor about Middle Eastern politics. A Palestinian who spent much of his childhood in Egypt, Said has long fought for the Palestinian cause and has spoken out against recent Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and against Yasir Arafat, whom he calls \"unreformable.\" His most famous book, Orientalism (1978), explored how Western intellectuals have viewed and represented the Arab world. In the spirit of that volume, in the 1980s, Said observed how U.S. media cast \"[t]he Middle East as a place whose violent and incomprehensible events are routinely referred back to a distant past full of 'ancient' tribal, religious, or ethnic hatreds.\" Said, a literature professor at Columbia University (where Viswanathan is his colleague), has also received accolades as a literary and cultural critic. Spanning 25 years, these interviews enhance both of these reputations. The first part, concerning literary criticism and cultural theory, demonstrates Said's willingness to think outside of the box of prescribed progressive convictions. For example, as a passionate believer in combining scholarship with activism, he's unafraid to criticize academic Marxists for failing to combine theories and practice. The interviews in the second part center on Said's attempt to find practical applications for his political ideas, primarily in the Middle East. He also discusses Saddam Hussein, nationalism, Salman Rushdie's underground existence, classical music and a host of other topics. Those interested in an overview of Said's ideas and oeuvre should start with this book.\"",

            "description": "\"The first comprehensive biography of the most influential, controversial, and celebrated Palestinian intellectual of the twentieth century\nAs one of Edward Said\u2019s graduate students and close friends until his death in 2003, Timothy Brennan had unprecedented access to his thesis adviser\u2019s ideas and legacy. In this authoritative work, Said, the pioneer of postcolonial studies, a tireless champion for his native Palestine, and an erudite literary critic, emerges as a self-doubting, tender, eloquent advocate of literature\u2019s dramatic effects on politics and civic life.\nCharting the intertwined routes of Said\u2019s intellectual development, Places of Mind reveals him as a study in opposites: a cajoler and strategist, a New York intellectual with a foot in Beirut, an orchestra impresario in Weimar and Ramallah, a raconteur on national television, a Palestinian negotiator at the State Department, and an actor in films in which he played himself. Brennan traces the Arab influences on Said\u2019s thinking along with his tutelage under Lebanese statesmen, off-beat modernist auteurs, and New York literati, as Said grew into a scholar whose influential writings changed the face of university life forever. With both intimidating brilliance and disarming charm, Said melded these resources into a groundbreaking and influential countertradition of radical humanism, set against the backdrop of techno-scientific dominance and religious war. With unparalleled clarity, Said gave the humanities a new authority in the age of Reaganism, one that continues today.\nDrawing on the testimonies of family, friends, students, and antagonists alike, and aided by FBI files, unpublished writings, and Said\u2019s personal letters, Places of Mind synthesizes Said\u2019s intellectual breadth and influence into an unprecedented, intimate, and compelling portrait of one of the great minds of the twentieth century.\"",

Said in 2003, various academic and public intellectuals worldwide have begun to reassess the writings of this powerful oppositional intellectual. Figures on the neoconservative right, who have become influential in the policy-making of George W. Bush's administration, have already begun to discredit Said's work as that of a subversive intent on slandering America's benign global image and undermining its global authority. On the left, a significant number of oppositional intellectuals are eager to counter this neoconservative vilification, proffering a Said who, in marked opposition to the \"anti-humanism\" of the great poststructuralist thinkers who were his contemporaries--Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franc\u0327ois Lyotard, Jacques Lacan, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault--reaffirms humanism and thus rejects poststructuralist theory. In this provocative assessment of Edward Said's lifework, William V. Spanos argues that Said's lifelong anti-imperialist project is actually a fulfillment of the revolutionary possibilities of poststructuralist theory. Spanos examines Said, his legacy, and the various texts he wrote--including Orientalism, Culture and Imperialism, and Humanism and Democratic Criticism--that are now being considered for their lasting political impact.\"",

By combining broad-scale literary history with granular attention to the vocabulary of criticism, Nicolas Vandeviver brings to light the harmonizing of methodological conflicts that informs Said's approach to literature; and argues that Said's enduring political significance is grounded in his practice as a literary critic.\"",

Spanos, explores the affiliative relationship between Arendt's and Said's thought, not simply their mutual emphasis on the importance of the exilic consciousness in an age characterized by the decline of the nation-state and the rise of globalization, but also on the oppositional politics that a displaced consciousness enables. The pairing of these two extraordinary intellectuals is unusual and controversial because of their ethnic identities. In radically secularizing their comportment towards being, their exilic condition enabled them to undertake inaugural critiques of the culture of the nation-state system of Western modernity.\"\"As variations on the theme of exile, the five chapters of this book constitute reflections on what is foundational and abiding in both Arendt's and Said's work. They not only document the heretofore unnoticed affiliation between the two thinkers. They also shed light on Arendt's and Said's proleptic activist explorations of the urgent \"question of Palestine,\" especially on the fraught present situation, which bears increasing witness to the irony that the Israeli nation-state's \"solution\" has, from the beginning, systematically repeated the degradations the Jewish people suffered at the hands of German nationalism.\"",

            "description": "\"This article analyzes the Algerian writer Assia Djebar's uncertain and ambiguous relationship with feminism. While her work is clearly preoccupied with women's experiences, the notion of a collective feminine identity remains a subject of contention, and female characters are frequently presented as both singular and elusive. In Vaste est la prison, the author sets out to trace a coherent genealogy of Algerian women, but the narrative at once hints at and disrupts any clear linking threads. For this reason, I argue that feminist resistance for Djebar revolves not around the uncomplicated celebration of female solidarity, but around a continual shifting between collective and singular critique. Women's resistance to patriarchal oppression in Algeria consists of a continual process of convergence and divergence. Djebar does not propose a single feminist argument but charts instead the very difficult process of creating a shared concrete cause.\"",

But such battles of authorship extend well beyond a single cultural moment.\nIn her gripping study of unsung female narratives of the Algerian War, Mildred Mortimer excavates and explores the role of women\u2019s individual and collective memory in recording events of the violent anticolonial conflict. Presenting close readings of published works spanning five decades\u2014from Assia Djebar\u2019s 1962 Children of the New World to Zohra Drif\u2019s 2014 Inside the Battle of Algiers: Memoir of a Woman Freedom Fighter\u2014 Women Fight, Women Write traces stylistic and material transformations in Algerian women\u2019s writings as it reveals evolving attitudes toward memory, trauma, historical objectivity, and women\u2019s political empowerment. Refuting the stale binary of men in battle, women at home, these testimonial texts let women lay claim to the Algerian War story as participants and also as chroniclers through fiction, historical studies, and memoir.\nAlgeria\u2019s patriarchal norms long kept women from speaking publicly about private matters, silencing their experiences of the war. Still, the conflict has ceaselessly sparked creative work. The country\u2019s dark decade of violent struggle between the Algerian army and Islamist fundamentalists in the 1990s brought the liberation struggle back into focus, inspiring and emboldening many more women to defiantly write. Women Fight, Women Write advances the broken silence, illuminating its vital historical revisions and literary innovations.\"",

Their works affirm the chance for thinking afforded by marginalization and exclusion and delineate political ways of preserving a space for difference informed by expropriation and nonbelonging. Cixous's inquiry is steeped in her formative encounter with the grudging integration of the Jews in French Algeria, while Djebar's narratives concern the colonial separation of \"French\" and \"Arab,\" self and other.

            "description": "\"As part of the conference \"\u2009Women in struggle\u2009\", on March 8, 1990 in Fez, Assia Djebar began her speech with the following sentence: \"\u2009For Arab women, I believe that we have ensured, for about 14 centuries, that women's writings are buried, erased, suppressed and, my God, as for the words, we put forward much more often, I would say, the most mournful words, of those who cry, of those who are in mourning and not so much of those who claim, those who oppose and those who stand up\".\nFar from being buried, the writings of Assia Djebar knew, well before her disappearance in 2015, an important echo. Nevertheless, the line of force that runs through her texts is her desire to give voice to other women, to those who have been deprived of speech by all kinds of arbitrarily imposed male sovereignty. While the first works of Assia Djebar evoke the struggle of women on a daily basis, their confinement in traditional Algerian society, their lack of communication with the outside world and their desire for emancipation, her theme gradually opens up to a wide range of subjects who, without ever denying it, go beyond the ethnic, linguistic and cultural identity of their origins.\nThe purpose of this symposium is to pay tribute to the literary and critical contribution of this first writer from the Maghreb to be received at the French Academy (in 2005) without limiting itself to the Franco-Algerian postcolonial universe. If Assia Djebar rightly remarks that the female voice of protest was traditionally gagged among her compatriots, this practice of muzzling largely transcends the Eastern space. For, despite progress towards gender equality and the proven achievements of parity, even in the West of the 21st century, female expression that does not conform to the tone of decay and sentimentality considered decent for the \"weaker sex\" is likely to be overlooked.\"",

More than a quarter century after his death, Louis Althusser, one of the most influential leftist thinkers of the 20th century, remains an enigmatic figure: a man whose work rejuvenated Marxist theory through books such as For Marx and Reading Capital, a Communist who strove to create a new framework following the revelations of Stalinist terror... and a victim of mental illness who, in his darkest moment, strangled his wife of more than 30 years.\nALTHUSSER, AN INTELLECTUAL ADVENTURE traces the development of Althusser's thought, which influenced a who's who of French philosophers, including Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, and Barthes. Credited with reinterpreting Marx in a way that encouraged readers to engage directly with his work, Althusser brought the Freudian concept of overdetermination to Marxist theory, and argued that Marx's work should not be read as one consistent whole, because there was a clear 'break' between his earlier and later writings. But Althusser's most enduring contribution may be the concept of ideological state apparatuses: institutions and social structures including schools, churches, and families, that serve to reinforce the capitalist state.\nALTHUSSER, AN INTELLECTUAL ADVENTURE captures the man, and the implications of his work, in interviews with friends and colleagues such as Lucien Seve, who served more than 30 years on the central committee of the Communist Party of France, and with philosophers and former students including Etienne Balibar, Pierre Macherey, and Jacques Ranciere.\"",

            "description": "\"This chapter offers a portrait of postcolonial queer of color formations emerged in the Netherlands through the 1980s and 1990s, paying specific attention to the nature of their intellectual labor. In the first section of the chapter, we sketch the conditions of emergence of Sister Outsider and Strange Fruit and we discuss the nature of their collective intellectual labor, including the work of translation. Hence, in the second and third sections, we offer brief portraits of two activist intellectuals: Andre Reeder of Strange Fruit and Gloria Wekker of Sister Outsider. We turn to Reeder and Wekker to complicate any simple account of collective intellectual labor. On the one hand, it is essential that we recognize the intellectual labor performed by collectives and movements themselves; and that we disarticulate, at least in part, the function of public intellectuality from the work of exceptional individuals. This is one of the central merits of this volume and one of the aims of our chapter. On the other hand, we maintain that it would be reductive to overlook the multiple interactions between collectives and intellectuals, and that the focus on collective intellectual labor should not write off the contributions of key intellectual figures. The stories of Sister Outsider and Strange Fruit, at least, suggest that the dialectic between political collectives and activist intellectuals is part and parcel of the intellectual labor performed by social movements.\"",

            "description": "\"This thesis examines the everyday experiences of people active within the Black, Migrant and Refugee (BMR) Movement (1980 \u2013 2000s) in the Netherlands and the role of the archive therein. Based on sixteen months of multi-site archival research and interviews conducted with women active within the BMR Movement, I argue that practices and everyday manifestations of diasporic kinship, intimacy and queer forms of care inform and shape this intricate network of connections and exchanges. These articulations of belonging and creative interruptions trouble dominant ideas about race, sexuality and place in the wider Dutch context. The thesis includes an analysis of three significant BMR collectives, Flamboyant, Sister Outsider and Strange Fruit, to investigate everyday political experiences using the following themes: spatiality and belonging, transnational feminist exchange, intimacy and kinship, and queer of colour politics and cultural work. Subsequently, I provide two broader thematic contemplations on care and futurity addressing the ghosts, hauntings and queer aesthetics within the archive. By examining how archives are used, this project moves away from centring the archive as an end-goal for feminist and queer organising and emphasises the tensions in archival practice, memorialization, non-narrativity, and language that are embedded in the making of a BMR genealogy. Overall, I argue that the BMR movement does not constitute an \u2018alternative\u2019 or \u2018counter-archive\u2019, but rather disrupts what becomes legible as archive.\"",

Both works hybridize traditional notions of London purported in 20th-century London fictions, which tend to concentrate on the city\u2019s iconic centre without mentioning its history of religious and (neo-)colonial exploitation. The analysis explores how spoken texts, photographs and sound recordings interact in the slideshow and scrutinizes the crucial role that intertextual references to Conrad, Eliot and Selvon play in both works, marking a resistance to historical preconceptions. Finally, a discussion of symbolic, imaginary and documentary dimensions of space will show how the use of different expressive media brings the multi-layered experience of being Black in London to the fore.\"",

The aim of the factory councils was to promote mass revolution and they gathered workers of all political stripes on the left, from anarchists to socialists. Their broad position was supported by the Third Communist International and by Lenin. But these ultimately failed to bring about the national insurrection that had led to the Russian Revolution. Gramsci was on the other side of the political debate that split the young Italian Marxist movement, and whose protagonists were Amadeo Bordiga and other socialists who did not agree with the broad church of the factory councils promoted by the Gramscian branch of the party. Gramsci subsequently acknowledged that Italy was probably not ready for revolution a that point in time."
