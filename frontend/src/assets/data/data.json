            "description": "\u201cBoth the new \u2018Caribbean cinema\u2019, which has now joined the company of the other \u2018Third Cinemas\u2019, and the emerging cinemas of Afro-Caribbean blacks in the \u2018diasporas\u2019 of the West, put the issue of cultural identity in question. Who is this emergent, new subject of the cinema? From where does it speak? The practices of representation always implicate the positions from which we speak or write \u2013 the positions of enunciation. What recent theories of enunciation suggest is that, though we speak, to say \u2018in our own name\u2019, of ourselves and from our own experience, nevertheless who speaks, and the subject who is spoken of, are never exactly in the same place. Identity is not as transparent or unproblematic as we think. Perhaps, instead of thinking of identity as an already accomplished historical fact, which the new cinematic discourses then represent, we should think, instead, of identity as a \u2018production\u2019, which is never complete, always in process, and always constituted within, not outside, representation. But this view problematizes the very authority and authenticity to which the term, \u2018cultural identity\u2019, lays claim. In this paper, then, I seek to open a dialogue, an investigation, on the subject of cultural identity and cinematic representation.\u201d",

In my view, Gramsci\u2019s work does not offer a general social science which can be applied to the analysis of social phenomena across a wide comparative range of historical societies. His potential contribution is more limited. It remains, for all that, of seminal importance. His work is, precisely, of a \u2018sophisticating\u2019 kind. He works, broadly, within the marxist paradigm. However, he has extensively revised, renovated and sophisticated many aspects of that theoretical framework to make it more relevant to contemporary social relations in the twentieth century. His work therefore has a direct bearing on the question of the \u2018adequacy\u2019 of existing social theories, since it is precisely in the direction of \u2018complexifying existing theories and problems\u2019 that his most important theoretical contribution is to be found. These points require further clarification before a substantive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and assessment of Gramsci\u2019s theoretical contribution can be offered.\"",

Where is the invisible line between it and its \u2018others\u2019 (colonialism, neo-colonialism, Third World, imperialism), in relation to whose termination it ceaselessly, but without final supersession, marks itself? The main purpose of this paper is to explore the interrogation marks which have begun to cluster thick and fast around the question of \u2018the post-colonial\u2019 and the notion of post-colonial times. If post-colonial time is the time after colonialism, and colonialism is defined in terms of the binary division between the colonisers and the colonized, why is post-colonial time also a time of \u2018difference? What sort of \u2018difference\u2019 is this and what are its implications for the forms of politics and for subject formation in this late-modern moment? These questions increasingly haunt the contested space in which the concept of the \u2018post-colonial\u2019 now operates and they cannot be satisfactorily explored until we know more about what the concept means and why it has become the bearer of such powerful unconscious investments \u2013 a sign of desire for some, and equally for others, a signifier of danger.\u201d",

As chair of both inIVA and Autograph ABP, Stuart played an integral role in realizing this vision of a publcia space dedicated to creativity and diversity. The \u00a33 million building, designed by architect David Adjaye, offers a place to exhibit art but it also provides a home for idea, thought and reflection upon the relevance of difference to the visual arts. A few weeks after its doors were opened officially, Rivington Place hosted the launch of Paul Gilroy\u2019s Black Britain: A Photographic History (2007). The book, planned initially to be a collaboration with Stuart Hall, portrays and documents the position or black people within British society through photographs drawn from the Getty Collection. Stuart\u2019s health prevented him from playing a full role in its completion, but he contributed a preface and at the launch he discussed the project with Paul Gilroy in front of an audience gathered to celebrate its publication.\u201d",

In a conversatin both intimate and sweeping in scope, Hall describes his migration from Jamaice to England, his immersion in left-wing politics in London, the influence of Raymond Williams and E.P. Thompson on the evolution of his thought, and the context within which the early classic texts of cultural studies was written. Hall also shares his pessimism about the economic recession and his optimism about Barack Obama\u2019s victory. Future analysis of Hall\u2019s work, and of cultural studies in general, will be enriched by this fascinating and indispensible first-person account of his life and ideas.\"",

This cultural obliteration is made possible by the negation of national reality, by new legal relations introduced by the occupying power, by the banishment of the natives and their customs to outlying districts by colonial society, by expropriation, and by the systematic enslaving of men and women.\nThree years ago at our first congress I showed that, in the colonial situation, dynamism is replaced fairly quickly by a substantification of the attitudes of the colonising power. The area of culture is then marked off by fences and signposts. These are in fact so many defence mechanisms of the most elementary type, comparable for more than one good reason to the simple instinct for preservation. The interest of this period for us is that the oppressor does not manage to convince himself of the objective non-existence of the oppressed nation and its culture. Every effort is made to bring the colonised person to admit the inferiority of his culture which has been transformed into instinctive patterns of behaviour, to recognise the unreality of his \u2018nation\u2019, and, in the last extreme, the confused and imperfect character of his own biological structure.\"",

He lived among Kingston's stiflingly respectable brown middle class, who, in their habits and ambitions, measured themselves against the white elite. As colonial rule was challenged, things began to change in Kingston and across the world. In 1951 a Rhodes scholarship took Hall across the Atlantic to Oxford University, where he met young Jamaicans from all walks of life, as well as writers and thinkers from across the Caribbean, including V. S. Naipaul and George Lamming. While at Oxford he met Raymond Williams, Charles Taylor, and other leading intellectuals, with whom he helped found the intellectual and political movement known as the New Left. With the emotional aftershock of colonialism still pulsing through him, Hall faced a new struggle: that of building a home, a life, and an identity in a postwar England so rife with racism that it could barely recognize his humanity.\nWith great insight, compassion, and wit, Hall tells the story of his early life, taking readers on a journey through the sights, smells, and streets of 1930s Kingston while reflecting on the thorny politics of 1950s and 1960s Britain. Full of passion and wisdom, Familiar Stranger is the intellectual memoir of one of our greatest minds.\"",

It also features public lectures, political articles, and popular pieces that circulated in periodicals and newspapers, which demonstrate the breadth and depth of Hall's contribution to public discourses of race. Foregrounding how and why the analysis of race and difference should be concrete and not merely descriptive, this collection gives organizers and students of social theory ways to approach the interconnections of race with culture and consciousness, state and society, policing and freedom.\"",

It is a painful re-membering, a putting together of the dismembered past to make sense of the trauma of the present. Fanon's work will not be possessed by political moment or movement, nor can it be easily placed in a seamless narrative of liberationist history. Fanon's demand for a psychoanalytic explanation emerges from the perverse reflections of 'civil virtue' in the alienating acts of colonial governance: the visibility of cultural 'mummification' in the colonizer's avowed ambition to civilize or modernize the native which results in 'archaic inert institutions under the oppressor's supervision like a caricature of formerly fertile institutions'. The familiar alignment of colonial subjects, Black/White, Self/Other, is disturbed with one brief pause and the traditional grounds of racial identity are dispersed, whenever they are found to rest in the narcissistic myths of Negritude or White cultural supremacy.\"",

Brown Skin, White Masks picks up where Frantz Fanon left off. Dabashi extends Fanon\u2019s insights as they apply to today\u2019s world.\nDabashi shows how intellectuals who migrate to the West are often used by the imperial powers to misrepresent their home countries. Just as many Iraqi exiles were used to justify the invasion of Iraq, Dabashi demonstrates that this is a common phenomenon, and examines why and how so many immigrant intellectuals help to sustain imperialism.\nThe book radically alters Edward Said\u2019s notion of the \u201cintellectual exile,\u201d in order to show the negative impact of intellectual migration. Dabashi examines the ideology of cultural superiority, and provides a passionate account of how these immigrant intellectuals \u2014 rootless compradors, and guns for hire \u2014 continue to betray any notion of home or country in order to manufacture consent for imperial projects.\"",

Tracing the conjunction of Blackness with the biological fiction of race, he theorizes Black reason as the collection of discourses and practices that equated Blackness with the nonhuman in order to uphold forms of oppression. Mbembe powerfully argues that this equation of Blackness with the nonhuman will serve as the template for all new forms of exclusion. With Critique of Black Reason, Mbembe offers nothing less than a map of the world as it has been constituted through colonialism and racial thinking while providing the first glimpses of a more just future.\"",

Fanon's Italian reception is interesting for postcolonial scholars in that it differs from the Anglo-American tradition of Fanonian scholarship, and reveals a \u2018pre-postcolonial\u2019 Fanon, prior to his revival through the \u2018symptomatic readings\u2019 of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and other theorists in the 1980s. I also discuss the editorial history of Fanon's publication in Italian; Italy was the first country after France in which Fanon's work appeared, and Giovanni Pirelli's 1971 edition of Fanon's writings, Opere scelte, is possibly the only anthology that presents a selection of essays culled from Fanon's different texts. The Italian Fanon, then, not only offers us an interpretation of the thinker that is specific to Italy, but also serves to historicize his impact in relation to the intellectual and political developments of his time.\"",

He outlines how democracy has begun to embrace its dark side---what he calls its \u201cnocturnal body\u201d---which is based on the desires, fears, affects, relations, and violence that drove colonialism. This shift has hollowed out democracy, thereby eroding the very values, rights, and freedoms liberal democracy routinely celebrates. As a result, war has become the sacrament of our times in a conception of sovereignty that operates by annihilating all those considered enemies of the state. Despite his dire diagnosis, Mbembe draws on post-Foucauldian debates on biopolitics, war, and race as well as Fanon's notion of care as a shared vulnerability to explore how new conceptions of the human that transcend humanism might come to pass. These new conceptions would allow us to encounter the Other not as a thing to exclude but as a person with whom to build a more just world.\"",

Thus Fanon\u2019s \u201cuntidy dialectic,\u201d Gibson contends, is a philosophy of liberation that includes cultural and historical issues and visions of a future society. In a profoundly political sense, Gibson asks us to reevaluate Fanon\u2019s contribution as a critic of modernity and reassess in a new light notions of consciousness, humanism, and social change.\nThis is a fascinating study that will interest undergraduates and above in postcolonial studies, literary theory, cultural studies, sociology, politics, and social and political theory, as well as general readers.\"",

The implications of his description will then be used to illuminate aspects of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello from last week, and also to look forward to Tayeb Salih\u2019s Season of Migration to the North next week.\"",

This transversal work in networks should serve to connect places and to confront his thought with the experiences, problems and problematics of the present and to show their topicality, because one of the dimensions of Fanon's thought is its \u201cglobality. \u00bb\"",

His work drew on a wide array of poetry, psychology, philosophy, and political theory, and its influence across the global South has been wide, deep, and enduring. In his lifetime, he published two key original works: Black Skin, White Masks (Peau noire, masques blancs) in 1952 and The Wretched of the Earth (Les damn\u00e9s de la terre) in 1961. Collections of essays, A Dying Colonialism (L\u2019an V de la r\u00e9volution Alg\u00e9rienne 1959) and Toward the African Revolution (Pour la revolution Africaine), posthumously published in 1964, round out a portrait of a radical thinker in motion, moving from the Caribbean to Europe to North Africa to sub-Saharan Africa and transforming his thinking at each stop. \nFanon engaged the fundamental issues of his day: language, affect, sexuality, gender, race and racism, religion, social formation, time, and many others. His impact was immediate upon arrival in Algeria, where in 1953 he was appointed to a position in psychiatry at Bilda-Joinville Hospital. His participation in the Algerian revolutionary struggle shifted his thinking from theorizations of blackness to a wider, more ambitious theory of colonialism, anti-colonial struggle, and visions for a postcolonial culture and society.\"",

Nor is any term so freely or diversely invoked on the Left as that of hegemony, to which he gave currency. Gramsci\u2019s reputation, still local and marginal outside his native Italy in the early sixties, has a decade later become a world-wide fame. The homage due to his enterprise in prison is now\u2014 thirty years after the first publication of his notebooks\u2014finally and fully being paid. Lack of knowledge, or paucity of discussion, have ceased to be obstacles to the diffusion of his thought. In principle every revolutionary socialist, not only in the West\u2014if especially in the West\u2014can henceforward benefit from Gramsci\u2019s patrimony. Yet at the same time, the spread of Gramsci\u2019s renown has not to date been accompanied by any corresponding depth of enquiry into his work. The very range of the appeals now made to his authority, from the most contrasted sectors of the Left, suggests the limits of close study or comprehension of his ideas. The price of so ecumenical an admiration is necessarily ambiguity: multiple and incompatible interpretations of the themes of the Prison Notebooks.\"",

It was during this imprisonment that Gramsci wrote his famous Prison Notebooks \u2013 over 2,000 pages of profound and influential reflections on history, culture, politics, philosophy and revolution.\nAn Introduction to Antonio Gramsci retraces the trajectory of Gramsci's life, before examining his conceptions of culture, politics and philosophy. Gramsci's writings are then interpreted through the lens of his most famous concept, that of 'hegemony'; Gramsci's thought is then extended and applied to 'think through' contemporary problems to illustrate his distinctive historical methodology. The book concludes with a valuable examination of Gramsci's legacy today and useful tips for further reading.\nGeorge Hoare and Nathan Sperber make Gramsci accessible for students of history, politics and philosophy keen to understand this seminal figure in 20th-century intellectual history.\"",

            "description": "\"This is the first work in English to deal comprehensively with Italian anarchism from the beginning of the century to the rise of fascism. It reconstructs the development of anarchist and syndicalist ideas and programmes and charts their relations with Gramsci and the Turin- based Ordine Nuovo group. The book places these developments within the general context of little known links connecting Italian anarchists and syndicalists to sympathizers in Britain, France, Germany and Russia. The analysis of 'libertarian' politics in Italy is accompanied by a detailed and fascinating reconstruction of the social base of Italian anarchism that challenges the assumptions of much of the political sociology of the European Left. Developing a hitherto unexplored but important aspect of Gramsci's political ideas and strategies, this book contributes to our understanding of one of the central Marxist thinkers and activists of the twentieth century and to one of the critical moments in the history of the European Left. In bringing new life and understanding to an important chapter in contemporary Italian history, this book is likely to become a standard text on this pivotal thinker.\"",

He reviews the works of Gramsci, Negri, Castoriadis and Lefort, and engages with the arguments made by E. P.

            "description": "\"Taking stock of contemporary social, cultural, and political currents, Timothy Brennan explores key turning points in the recent history of American intellectual life. He contends that a certain social-democratic vision of politics has been banished from public discussion, leading to an unlikely convergence of the political right and the academic left and a deadening of critical opposition. Brennan challenges the conventional view that affiliations based on political belief, claims upon the state, or the public interest have been rendered obsolete by the march of events in the years before and after Reagan. Instead, he lays out a new path for a future infused with a sense of intellectual and political possibility.\nIn highlighting the shift in America's intellectual culture, Brennan makes the case for seeing belief as an identity. As much as race or ethnicity, political belief, Brennan argues, is itself an identity-one that remains unrecognized and without legal protections while possessing its own distinctive culture. Brennan also champions the idea of cosmopolitanism and critiques those theorists who relegate the left to the status of postcolonial \"other.\"\nWars of Position documents how alternative views were chased from the public stage by strategic acts of censorship, including within supposedly dissident wings of the humanities. He explores how the humanities entered the cultural and political mainstream and settled into an awkward secular religion of the \"middle way.\" In a series of interrelated chapters, Brennan considers narratives of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Clinton impeachment; reexamines Salman Rushdie's pre-fatwa writing to illuminate its radical social leanings; presents a startling new interpretation of Edward Said; looks at the fatal reception of Antonio Gramsci within postcolonial history and criticism; and offers a stinging critique of Hardt and Negri's Empire and the influence of Italian radicalism on contemporary cultural theory. Throughout the work, Brennan also draws on and critiques the ideas and influence of Heidegger, Lyotard, Kristeva, and other influential theorists.\"",

            "description": "\"What is colonialism and what is a colonial state? Ranajit Guha points out that the colonial state in South Asia was fundamentally different from the metropolitan bourgeois state which sired it. The metropolitan state was hegemonic in character, and its claim to dominance was based on a power relation in which persuasion outweighed coercion. Conversely, the colonial state was non-hegemonic, and in its structure of dominance coercion was paramount. Indeed, the originality of the South Asian colonial state lay precisely in this difference: a historical paradox, it was an autocracy set up and sustained in the East by the foremost democracy of the Western world. It was not possible for that non-hegemonic state to assimilate the civil society of the colonized to itself. Thus the colonial state, as Guha defines it in this closely argued work, was a paradox\u2014a dominance without hegemony.\nDominance without hegemony had a nationalist aspect as well. This arose from a structural split between the elite and subaltern domains of politics, and the consequent failure of the Indian bourgeoisie to integrate vast areas of the life and consciousness of the people into an alternative hegemony. That predicament is discussed in terms of the nationalist project of anticipating power by mobilizing the masses and producing an alternative historiography. In both endeavors the elite claimed to speak for the people constituted as a nation and sought to challenge the pretensions of an alien regime to represent the colonized. A rivalry between an aspirant to power and its incumbent, this was in essence a contest for hegemony.\"",

With a thirst for information extending to the other continents, and hence to Europe\u2019s relations with them, it would scarcely have been possible for Gramsci not to be drawn to the subject of imperialism. In his brief years of active politics Gramsci never missed an occasion to draw parallels between the exploited peasantry at home and the colonial peoples abroad; and he identified colonialism, for instance in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies in 1925, with export of capital. In examining the Risorgimento, Gramsci was acutely conscious of the gulf between northern and southern Italy, a dichotomy akin, as he said, to that of town and countryside. Gramsci\u2019s underlying aim was to reach an understanding of what Japanese intellectuals stood for.\"",

Spivak's essay hones in on the historical and ideological factors that obstruct the possibility of being heard for those who inhabit the periphery. It is a probing interrogation of what it means to have political subjectivity, to be able to access the state, and to suffer the burden of difference in a capitalist system that promises equality yet withholds it at every turn.\nSince its publication, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" has been cited, invoked, imitated, and critiqued. In these phenomenal essays, eight scholars take stock of the effects and response to Spivak's work. They begin by contextualizing the piece within the development of subaltern and postcolonial studies and the quest for human rights. Then, through the lens of Spivak's essay, they rethink historical problems of subalternity, voicing, and death. A final section situates \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" within contemporary issues, particularly new international divisions of labor and the politics of silence among indigenous women of Guatemala and Mexico. In an afterword, Spivak herself considers her essay's past interpretations and future incarnations and the questions and histories that remain secreted in the original and revised versions of \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\"\u0097both of which are reprinted in this book.\"",

Specifically, this book endeavors to reassess the impact on postcolonial studies of the central role assigned by Gramsci to culture and literature in the formation of a truly revolutionary idea of the national\u2014a notion that has profoundly shaped the thinking of both Frantz Fanon and Edward Said. Gramsci, as Iain Chambers has argued, has been instrumental in helping scholars rethink their understanding of historical, political, and cultural struggle by substituting the relationship between tradition and modernity with that of subaltern versus hegemonic parts of the world. Combining theoretical reflections and re-interpretations of Gramsci, the scholars in this collection present comparative geo-cultural perspectives on the meaning of the subaltern, passive revolution, hegemony, and the concept of national-popular culture in order to chart out a political map of the postcolonial through the central focus on Gramsci.\"",

La Fondazione Istituto Gramsci was born in 1982 and inherited the Institute's archival and library assets.

The aim of the factory councils was to promote mass revolution and they gathered workers of all political stripes on the left, from anarchists to socialists. Their broad position was supported by the Third Communist International and by Lenin. But these ultimately failed to bring about the national insurrection that had led to the Russian Revolution. Gramsci was on the other side of the political debate that split the young Italian Marxist movement, and whose protagonists were Amadeo Bordiga and other socialists who did not agree with the broad church of the factory councils promoted by the Gramscian branch of the party. Gramsci subsequently acknowledged that Italy was probably not ready for revolution a that point in time."
