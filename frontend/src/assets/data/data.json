Who is this emergent, new subject of the cinema? From where does it speak? The practices of representation always implicate the positions from which we speak or write \u2013 the positions of enunciation. What recent theories of enunciation suggest is that, though we speak, to say \u2018in our own name\u2019, of ourselves and from our own experience, nevertheless who speaks, and the subject who is spoken of, are never exactly in the same place. Identity is not as transparent or unproblematic as we think. Perhaps, instead of thinking of identity as an already accomplished historical fact, which the new cinematic discourses then represent, we should think, instead, of identity as a \u2018production\u2019, which is never complete, always in process, and always constituted within, not outside, representation. But this view problematizes the very authority and authenticity to which the term, \u2018cultural identity\u2019, lays claim. In this paper, then, I seek to open a dialogue, an investigation, on the subject of cultural identity and cinematic representation.\u201d",

In my view, Gramsci\u2019s work does not offer a general social science which can be applied to the analysis of social phenomena across a wide comparative range of historical societies. His potential contribution is more limited. It remains, for all that, of seminal importance. His work is, precisely, of a \u2018sophisticating\u2019 kind. He works, broadly, within the marxist paradigm. However, he has extensively revised, renovated and sophisticated many aspects of that theoretical framework to make it more relevant to contemporary social relations in the twentieth century. His work therefore has a direct bearing on the question of the \u2018adequacy\u2019 of existing social theories, since it is precisely in the direction of \u2018complexifying existing theories and problems\u2019 that his most important theoretical contribution is to be found. These points require further clarification before a substantive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and assessment of Gramsci\u2019s theoretical contribution can be offered.\"",

Where is the invisible line between it and its \u2018others\u2019 (colonialism, neo-colonialism, Third World, imperialism), in relation to whose termination it ceaselessly, but without final supersession, marks itself? The main purpose of this paper is to explore the interrogation marks which have begun to cluster thick and fast around the question of \u2018the post-colonial\u2019 and the notion of post-colonial times. If post-colonial time is the time after colonialism, and colonialism is defined in terms of the binary division between the colonisers and the colonized, why is post-colonial time also a time of \u2018difference? What sort of \u2018difference\u2019 is this and what are its implications for the forms of politics and for subject formation in this late-modern moment? These questions increasingly haunt the contested space in which the concept of the \u2018post-colonial\u2019 now operates and they cannot be satisfactorily explored until we know more about what the concept means and why it has become the bearer of such powerful unconscious investments \u2013 a sign of desire for some, and equally for others, a signifier of danger.\u201d",

This broad-ranging text offers treatment of how visual images, language and discourse work as \"systems of representation.\" Individual chapters explain a variety of approaches to representation, bringing to bear concepts from semiotic, discursive, psychoanalytic, anthropological, sociological, feminist, art-historical and Foucauldian models of representation. They explore representation as a signifying practice in a rich diversity of social contexts and institutional sites: the use of photography in the construction of national identity and culture; the poetics and politics of exhibiting other cultures in ethnographic museums; fantasies of \"the racialized other\" in popular media, film and image; the construction of masculine identities in discourses of consumer culture and advertising; and the gendering of narratives in television soap operas. This book provides illustrative examples with activities and selected readings, accessible but not simplified, offering a resource for teachers and students in cultural studies and related fields.\"",

As chair of both inIVA and Autograph ABP, Stuart played an integral role in realizing this vision of a publcia space dedicated to creativity and diversity. The \u00a33 million building, designed by architect David Adjaye, offers a place to exhibit art but it also provides a home for idea, thought and reflection upon the relevance of difference to the visual arts. A few weeks after its doors were opened officially, Rivington Place hosted the launch of Paul Gilroy\u2019s Black Britain: A Photographic History (2007). The book, planned initially to be a collaboration with Stuart Hall, portrays and documents the position or black people within British society through photographs drawn from the Getty Collection. Stuart\u2019s health prevented him from playing a full role in its completion, but he contributed a preface and at the launch he discussed the project with Paul Gilroy in front of an audience gathered to celebrate its publication.\u201d",

In a conversatin both intimate and sweeping in scope, Hall describes his migration from Jamaice to England, his immersion in left-wing politics in London, the influence of Raymond Williams and E.P. Thompson on the evolution of his thought, and the context within which the early classic texts of cultural studies was written. Hall also shares his pessimism about the economic recession and his optimism about Barack Obama\u2019s victory.

The eight foundational lectures Hall delivered at the University of Illinois in 1983 introduced North American audiences to a thinker and discipline that would shift the course of critical scholarship. Unavailable until now, these lectures present Hall's original engagements with the theoretical positions that contributed to the formation of Cultural Studies. Throughout this personally guided tour of Cultural Studies' intellectual genealogy, Hall discusses the work of Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, and E. P. Thompson; the influence of structuralism; the limitations and possibilities of Marxist theory; and the importance of Althusser and Gramsci. Throughout these theoretical reflections, Hall insists that Cultural Studies aims to provide the means for political change.\"",

            "description": "\"\"Sometimes I feel myself to have been the last colonial.\" This, in his own words, is the extraordinary story of the life and career of Stuart Hall\u2014how his experiences shaped his intellectual, political, and theoretical work and how he became one of his age's brightest intellectual lights.\nGrowing up in a middle-class family in 1930s Kingston, Jamaica, still then a British colony, the young Stuart Hall found himself uncomfortable in his own home. He lived among Kingston's stiflingly respectable brown middle class, who, in their habits and ambitions, measured themselves against the white elite. As colonial rule was challenged, things began to change in Kingston and across the world. In 1951 a Rhodes scholarship took Hall across the Atlantic to Oxford University, where he met young Jamaicans from all walks of life, as well as writers and thinkers from across the Caribbean, including V. S. Naipaul and George Lamming. While at Oxford he met Raymond Williams, Charles Taylor, and other leading intellectuals, with whom he helped found the intellectual and political movement known as the New Left. With the emotional aftershock of colonialism still pulsing through him, Hall faced a new struggle: that of building a home, a life, and an identity in a postwar England so rife with racism that it could barely recognize his humanity.\nWith great insight, compassion, and wit, Hall tells the story of his early life, taking readers on a journey through the sights, smells, and streets of 1930s Kingston while reflecting on the thorny politics of 1950s and 1960s Britain. Full of passion and wisdom, Familiar Stranger is the intellectual memoir of one of our greatest minds.\"",

These essays evaluate the legacies of his particular brand of cultural studies and demonstrate how other scholars and activists have utilized his thinking in their own research. Throughout, Hall's colleagues and collaborators assess his theoretical and methodological standpoints, his commitment to the development of a flexible form of revisionist Marxism, and the contributions of his specific mode of analysis to public debates on Thatcherism, neoliberalism, and multiculturalism. In her contribution, Angela Davis argues that the model of politics, ideology, and race initially developed by Hall and his colleagues in England continues to resonate when applied to America's racialized policing. Other essays focus on Hall's contributions to contemporary political debate and questions of race, ethnicity, identity, migrancy, and diaspora, and discuss Hall's continuing involvement in issues of representation and aesthetics in the visual arts, particularly photography and film.\"",
